<p><span class="style0">The limiting factor on analogue computers had been the fact that the physical accuracy of the model determined the accuracy of the resulting calculations. Electronic digital computers avoided this problem but had their own practical constraints. A machine built with relay switches was superseded by one which used vacuum tubes and could operate at much faster speeds. The computers of the 1950s employed a technology which essentially stretched back to Edison’s incandescent lamp, with updates from Fleming and De Forest. Just as previous models had been constrained, so too the computers based on vacuum tubes were limited by the characteristics of the tubes themselves. As the tubes were large and got hot, this meant that the more powerful the machine, the larger it needed to be, the more electrical power it consumed and the more heat that had to be dissipated.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The prevailing view on how big the market for these computers could become was based on these constraints. The cost of the machine and its maximum power could be estimated, and given this the potential market could be approximated. Under this scenario computers seemed likely to be profitable, but with applications limited to large private and public sector users. All of this was absolutely correct – except that it was predicated on an assumption that the technology would remain static. If the vacuum tubes could be replaced, then all the working assumptions fell by the wayside – which is exactly what happened. The vacuum tubes had come out of the lighting industry, but had been developed further to build the radio industry. The ability of the triode to amplify signals caused intense interest at AT&amp;T and the study of their properties became part of the scientific agenda at Bell Laboratories. Potential alternative media that could perform the same task without encountering the reliability and heat problems associated with the tubes were also studied. Out of this work was to emerge the transforming device of the transistor.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The invention of the transistor and its adoption by the computer industry did not happen overnight. First it had to become reliable and cost-effective when compared to existing tube technology. The transistor was invented in 1947 at Bell Laboratories by William Shockley, Walter Brattain and John Bardeen. The work had begun in the 1930s with the search for a replacement for the somewhat unreliable valves and physical switches then integral to telephone exchanges. Bell Labs had been working on the purification of silicon and Shockley had also been looking at the potential use of copper oxide as a rectifier. This led in turn to the exploration of semiconductors, i.e. material that conducted current in only one direction. This work was put on hold during the war, but the body of knowledge in the area increased as the development of RADAR created a demand for improvements in the availability and use of semiconducting materials.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">After the war the scientific group at Bell was reassembled and work began again on the task of investigating semiconductor amplifiers. After three years’ work, the ‘transistor’ was announced to the outside world, which welcomed it with a muted response. The initial perception was that what had been invented was a solid-state replacement for the valve. The replacement, while smaller and free from the heat and power problems of the valve, was less reliable and difficult to produce. As a consequence it did not immediately displace the valve, which retained its position as the main component of computers through the early development of the mainframe. The inventors of the transistor were to receive the 1956 Nobel Prize for their efforts, but by then Shockley had already left Bell Labs to set up his own company, Shockley Semiconductor, to exploit the technology.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory was funded by Rockefeller and established in Shockley’s hometown of Palo Alto, California in 1954. It comprised Shockley, plus a large number of scientists he had brought with him. The principal target of the group was to take the transistor and increase its reliability and reduce its cost by improving the manufacturing process, although this was frequently compromised by Shockley’s desire to find further new inventions. The group at Shockley did not last long as differences over policy and personality conflicts with Shockley himself contributed to a split in 1957. Eight of the key employees left as a group to be funded by Fairchild Camera and Instrument in a new venture called Fairchild Semiconductor. This company was to play a pivotal role in the development of the computer industry, and in many ways can be said to have spawned California’s Silicon Valley.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the early years, the company’s focus was a scientific race against Texas Instruments to overcome the drawbacks in the manufacture and reliability of hardwired devices. Their solution was to adapt the manufacturing process so that the electronic circuits could be reduced in size and placed on small pieces of semiconductor material. Texas Instruments was the first to achieve this and in 1959 filed for a patent on its semiconductor ‘chip’. This chip still required hardwiring and TI found themselves leapfrogged by Fairchild when Robert Noyce devised a method known as ‘planar’ manufacturing, whereby the wiring was actually embedded in the silicon. These two advances effectively combined to overtake the transistor and condemned the vacuum valve finally to obsolescence. The transistor had been slowly encroaching and IBM was forced to develop a successor to its valve-based 800 and 650 models. Its next machine, the 1401, was intended to replace these models and by incorporating transistors rather than valves was a big step forward in computing capability.</span> </p>
