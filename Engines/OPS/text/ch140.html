<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Moore and Noyce, colleagues since the Shockley days, left Fairchild in order to achieve greater control over the direction of their efforts. After discarding ‘Moore Noyce Electronics’ because of its phonetic connotations, the partners settled on Intel, an abbreviation of Integrated Electronics, for their new creation. Intel was formed in 1968 with seed capital of roughly $250,000 ($1.2m) provided by Moore and Noyce, augmented by a further $2.5m ($12m) from Arthur Rock. Rock had been involved in numerous industry start-ups in the nascent industry, including Fairchild, and was an enthusiastic advocate. From a very early stage he was convinced of the future success of the company.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The hurdle of perception was a relatively low one because Moore and Noyce had already demonstrated their ability. Perhaps more importantly, the commercial feasibility of what they were proposing had already been accepted by the financial markets and reflected in the Fairchild share price. They also had the support of Rock, whose track record was such that he was able to raise the funds for the new venture in two days simply by phoning his established business contacts.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Intel’s original intent was to focus on memory chips, but the one-page ‘business plan’ was more a statement of intent than a fully worked out document. What Intel was selling was the ability of its founders to produce new and complex integrated circuits. One avenue was memory chips, but the main driver would be from the emergence of a new use for integrated circuits. Intel was not alone in its desire to find new uses for integrated circuits which would increase the volume of production and hence improve productivity. Nor were they alone in recognising the need to make use of the chips in such a way as to demonstrate their use and act as a powerful marketing tool for further developments.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">What Intel really needed was a source of volume demand for its proposed products. The source of this volume demand would emanate from the demands which had originally stimulated the work of Charles Babbage, namely the need for accurate computation. Adding machines had increased in size and complexity as the technology shifted from analogue to digital computation. Mainframes and later minicomputers were able to undertake complex calculations with unprecedented accuracy and speed. This provided great assistance for government with its vast data processing requirements in the areas of defence and population study. However, for the rest of the population, the value was limited. Some electronic adding machines had been produced, but they possessed only very basic functions and, as pieces of precision equipment, were expensive to produce and purchase. This left a potential enormous market if an adding machine or calculator could be produced at a reasonable price.</span> </p>
