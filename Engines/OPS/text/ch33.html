<p><span class="style0">The railways built to link existing centres within Britain, Europe and the eastern part of America differed substantially from the great drive to open up the Western USA. During the Civil War, Congress had provided a series of incentives to encourage building of a transcontinental railroad. These were contained in the Pacific Railroad Act. This led to the establishment of Union Pacific, which would move west from Omaha and Central, and build track eastwards from Sacramento. As a response to promptings from interested lobbyists such as the Ames brothers (who owned one of the largest shovel manufacturers in America), and undoubtedly for some, in expectation of personal enrichment, Congress authorised loan payments equivalent to $16,000 per mile in flat land and $32,000 per mile for gradients, to subsidise the westwards expansion. In addition, each line was to be entitled to 20 alternate sections of land for each mile constructed. The economics of construction were therefore inadvertently framed so as to encourage quantity rather than quality, circuitous rather than straight routes, and speed above all else.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The newspapers recorded the excitement of the time as Union Pacific and Central Pacific raced towards each other across the great continent. The hostility of the terrain and the Indian population displaced by the new lines fuelled the public’s imagination as the ‘West’ was opened up. For the companies, it was obvious that the greatest short-term profit was to be had by building the road as cheaply as possible, and as quickly as possible, so as to garner as much of the government’s largesse as possible. The railroad operators did not find it difficult to accumulate wealth in such circumstances. The Union Pacific was granted 12m acres of land and a $27m ($3.3bn) government mortgage bond, while the Central Pacific gained 9m acres and $24m (nearly $3bn) government bond. Encouraged by this, other promoters soon followed. The Texas and Pacific received 18m acres and the Northern Pacific 44m acres along the Canadian border. These were only the initial fundraising exercises; in due course, all the major transcontinental railroads raised further funds in both America and Europe.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Despite their subsidies and loans, by the time the railroads finally met in 1869, they were both near bankruptcy. There were many contributory factors. First, the subsidies and incentives promoted speedy but inefficient construction. Second, there was the corrupt legal and political environment of the time. In order to protect their subsidies, railroads entertained the politicians lavishly and ensured that their private incomes were supplemented with bribes ranging from free railroad passes to stock in subsidiaries. History records the Credit Mobilier, the company set up to handle the construction contracts of the Union Pacific, as the most scandalous example. Unlike the Contract and Finance Company, which handled the contracts for Central Pacific, its financial records were found and aired to the general public. What Credit Mobilier did was relatively straightforward. It overcharged for its work. Stock in the company was held by the principals of Union Pacific, and also distributed to influential politicians to ensure the protection of the company’s privileges. Depending upon the estimates one accepts, it charged between two and three times the real cost of construction. The total cost of construction came to some $94m, against an estimated true cost of $44m, leaving some $50m ($4.8bn) effectively unaccounted for.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">When the Union Pacific required coal, for example, the directors of the railroad created a company called the Wyoming Coal and Mining Company, which supplied Union Pacific with coal at three times the cost of production. Those fortunate enough to have been made shareholders in Credit Mobilier prospered mightily, in sharp contrast to those with stock in either Union or Central Pacific. In 1872, the corruption became a matter of public record when one of the railroad’s principals, Oakes Ames, was called to testify before Congress and revealed the list of politicians who had been part of the group to benefit. The list included virtually every senior member of the Congress, Senate and White House. The revelations sent shock waves through the stock and commodity markets.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The Credit Mobilier affair was not sufficient to end the financial gyrations and manipulation of the railroads, because the scandal did nothing to inhibit the tools used by the speculators; nor did it undermine the growth fundamentals of the railroad business itself. So long as the business was growing, or at least perceived to be growing, investors were willing to continue to commit new funds. Equally, the Erie Railroad saga was neither a self-contained episode nor the conclusion of the struggle to gain pricing power within the railroad system. It was not long after Credit Mobilier that the debt ridden Union Pacific became a target for Jay Gould – and, with his success, brought the unfolding of a familiar scenario.</span> </p>
