<title>Durant joins the fray - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<h1 id="anchor_2513_0"><span class="style1">Durant joins the fray</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the same year that Ford introduced the Model T, William Durant began the process of trying to consolidate the automobile industry by acquisition. His goal was the creation of a concern with a portfolio of models to shield it from changing tastes and with the necessary size to internalise the production of components and reduce reliance on suppliers. The trend towards the creation of trusts – and the example of Standard Oil in maintaining prices and margins – would have played a role in underpinning the argument for the amalgamation of the major producers of the time. Durant turned a degree of independent wealth into a substantially larger fortune by building the Durant-Dort Carriage Company in Michigan, one of the largest carriage producers in the region. His knowledge of the carriage industry convinced him of the future of the automobile, and when the Buick Motor Car Company required capital to stay in existence Durant was on hand to take control.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">After initial success in resuscitating Buick, Durant began negotiations to create the largest company in the industry. In 1907, agreement seemed close in efforts to combine four of the largest producers: Buick, Maxwell-Briscoe, Reo and Ford. Henry Ford required $3m ($170m) cash for the sale, and while Durant’s group could raise this figure it was unable to meet the demand for equal treatment which immediately followed from Ransom E. Olds of Reo. This led to the deal collapsing and Durant moving on to incorporate the General Motors Company in 1908. With GM incorporated, Durant initiated a buying spree, purchasing Cadillac, Oldsmobile and Oakland (subsequently Pontiac).</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The acquisitions were financed with securities and debt and typically with little regard to profitability. (This judgement is perhaps rendered with the benefit of hindsight; it would be fairer to say that analysing future profitability at such an early stage in the development of the industry was a hazardous task.) Some commentators of the period, looking back, have suggested that the amalgamations were typically the result of a shortage of capital, since buoyant demand meant most manufacturers could sell their product relatively easily. The shortage-of-capital thesis does not appear to be borne out given the amount of capital raised in the early years and the proliferation of automobile companies. (This is not to say that for individual companies at particular times shortage of capital was not the critical issue, as it undoubtedly was in the case of US Motors.)</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Within a relatively short space of time, General Motors found the financial pressures intense – such that by 1910 its very survival depended upon new funding from a financial consortium. The severity of the position at General Motors required a cash injection of $15m (over $800m), but as was the case with other troubled recipients of capital, such as GE or AT&amp;T, the situation allowed the financial consortium to effectively dictate its own terms. These terms included the removal of Durant and the reorganisation of the company under Charles Nash, previously the head of Buick, and his replacement at Buick by Walter Chrysler.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Durant responded by teaming up with a Swiss emigrant racing driver named Louis Chevrolet, a former employee of Buick, to produce a new car to challenge the increasingly dominant Model T. Using the limited success of the new car, Durant was able to enlist the support of the Du Pont family and from 1913 onwards began his campaign to return to General Motors. Durant made an offer to trade Chevrolet stock for that of GM, which investors rapidly accepted despite the differential in size between the two companies. In combination with the Du Pont family, which sought to invest its booming war-time profits in General Motors, by 1915 Durant was able to regain control of General Motors with Pierre du Pont as his chairman.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Some of the senior management were to leave the company, most notably Henry Leland, who had replaced Ford and built up the successful Cadillac operation. Leland left in 1917 and ended up creating the Lincoln Motor Company to work on aircraft engines, converting to the production of luxury automobiles at the conclusion of World War I. A downturn in the market in 1920 caught the company short of cash and allowed Henry Ford to purchase the concern for $8m (over $200m). A similar fate was to befall General Motors. Durant had continued with his policy of acquisition, adding numerous component manufacturers such as Delco and the Hyatt Roller Bearing Company run by Alfred Sloan. Many other acquisitions followed, a number of which – such as the Guardian Frigerator Company (later Fridgidaire) – bore no relation to the automobile. Durant argued otherwise, on the basis that both the refrigerator and the automobile were simply boxes containing a <span id="anchor_2525_157"></span>motor.<a href="ch98.html#anchor_2777_0">⁵⁷</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Eventually these actions, born of the optimism of the time, caught up with both Durant and General Motors. Not only had Durant made GM an acquisitive vehicle, he had also taken a speculative approach to his own finances through his stock market activities and his personal exposure to GM stock. On top of this, the growth in the automobile industry had led to a lax approach to inventory control and cash management. When economic conditions worsened and the stock market fell, with GM stock dropping by 70%, Durant found both his personal wealth and the company he managed at risk. In order to avoid the panic that might have followed the personal bankruptcy of Durant, a sum sufficient to cover his debts of $30m ($475m) was advanced by a combination of the Du Ponts and the Morgan banking dynasty in return for his 2.5 million shares in GM. In addition, the presidency of GM passed to Pierre du Pont (as a figurehead) but in an operational sense to Alfred Sloan. Durant’s triumphant return to the company had therefore lasted barely five years before, in 1920, he was again removed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">By this time Walter Chrysler had left the company to join the ailing Willys-Overland Company, which like its peers had been badly hit by the depression of 1920–21. Through his efforts at this company he had been invited to take over the running of the struggling Maxwell Motor Car Company, which had been part of an abortive attempt by one of Durant’s former partners to build another automobile conglomerate, the US Motor Company. It had been founded in 1910 and acquired many struggling manufacturers, such as the Columbia Motor Company, that had begun with Pope, moved into the Electric Vehicle Company and ended up with the US Motor Company. After reorganising the concern and producing successful new models, the company eventually took his name: becoming the Chrysler Company.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">General Motors</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">History records that twice in its early years General Motors would have gone into liquidation had it not been bailed out by injections of capital. On both occasions the root causes were the same: an acquisition policy that paid little regard to capital structure and the strategic rationale of the purchase prior to the transaction – and even less to the integration after its conclusion. Durant’s rule seems to have been to purchase anything available in a potentially related business with whatever funds were on hand at the time. Shareholder value was not high on his list of priorities.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The difficulty for the investor in such a scenario is in obtaining sufficient information on cash flow to anticipate any liquidity crisis. It is not, for example, always possible to be certain that the indebtedness reported at the holding company level is truly reflective of the capital position of the company. In theory the consolidated accounts should aggregate such figures, but where there has been a series of acquisitions, and where financial controls are suspect or less than rigorous, there is always the possibility of a lack of accurate reporting or non-conformity in accounting treatment of different items.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The 1909 financial statements for the components of General Motors were published, albeit in an aggregated form. The liability side of the balance sheet gave no information about the debt of subsidiaries, giving only figures for the capital stock and amounts payable. Investors had to make an assumption that the surplus (or profit and loss) accounted for the difference between the liabilities shown and the total assets.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Financial Chronicle</span><span class="style1">, for example, took the net worth figure for Buick released by GM as indicating that the surplus (or profit and loss) was roughly $9m, which when added to the payables and capital stock pretty much equalled the total assets figure.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Yet as the 1910 figures were to show, this was an erroneous assumption, as by that point Buick was carrying debt approaching $8m. GM’s 1909 annual report also showed net income of $8.6m and a profit margin over 30%. The figure would therefore have looked internally consistent, as there was no reason to anticipate rising debt levels against such a buoyant and profitable backdrop.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The reality was that the organisation had been run without any meaningful central control over costs or operations. Acquisitions such as the Heany Lamp Company were made without any apparent awareness of mounting cash flow problems. Heany Lamp was purchased for 8,290 shares of GM preferred stock and 74,775 of common stock, which was more than the consideration paid for Buick and Cadillac combined. The net result on this occasion was that GM had to be rescued from the waiting receivers with an injection of $15m.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The cost to GM of the rescue was an underwriting fee of $2.25m together with a distribution of stock at par to the underwriters comprising $4.169m of preferred and $2m in common. Shareholders in GM experienced earnings dilution through debt cost and repayments, as well as the additional stock. The change in management associated with refinancing also proved costly, when the lenders took executive control until the repayment of the loan due in 1915. Profits fell sharply when Buick unwisely decided to drop production of its small car, the Model 10, which accounted for half its profits. As consequence of both the financing and the model changes, profits plummeted.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Durant’s second term in office was to end in much the same way as his first. The company reembarked upon the acquisition trail. The net outcome was similar to the 1910 experience. Poor management structure and information systems overlaid on a poor acquisition policy came home to roost when the post-war boom conditions reversed into a downturn. This time investors should have had an inkling of what was coming.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The return on assets had been declining ever since Durant returned to the company. Net income did rise, but only in response to buoyant market conditions and at the expense of substantial equity issuance and dilution. When the downturn came, GM was caught with inflated inventories and the unavoidable losses that accompany such a position. When Du Pont stepped in to underwrite his overgeared stock position, Durant was replaced by Alfred Sloan. GM then set off down a different path from where it eventually challenged and overtook Ford as the industry leader.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">For the investor, the lessons were relatively clear. A visionary is not necessarily, or even likely, to be able to manage the vision he creates. Durant’s personal financial affairs were as unstructured as the company he led. After one example of the Durant management style, the second period should not have come as much of a surprise, particularly when declining margins and stock dilution were obvious, though not all brokers at the time showed much awareness of the real position.</span> </p>
