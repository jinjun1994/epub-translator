<h1 id="anchor_2133_0"><span class="style1">Conclusions</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Oil was not a ‘new technology’ in the sense of the incandescent lamp or the locomotive engine, although there were many similarities. The uses of kerosene were widely known and the refining process itself was not new. Knowledge of the chemistry of rock oil</span> <span class="style1">was</span> <span class="style0">new, however, and it led to the creation of an entire new industry. This industry operated in a largely unregulated environment and for an extended period was characterised by price volatility and excess supply. The volatility was removed with a temporary period of monopoly control, but in general the response to pricing changes in the oil industry changed little in the century that followed. Although capital costs have risen sharply, exploration and production budgets still tend to rise when prices rise, which leads to periods of excess supply followed by falling prices.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The removal of volatile industry conditions was associated with a new company that came into existence and forced order on the industry. The purpose of the Standard Oil ‘trust’ was to create and sustain the benefits of monopoly pricing. The power of the trust came not from control of production but from the strength of its negotiating position with the providers of distribution, most notably the railroads. The railroads had a high fixed capital base and required throughput to maintain profitability. Since they were in fierce competition with each other, and there was excess supply, an opportunity presented itself to whoever could become the dominant customer. With a strong balance sheet and a willingness to take the risk of guaranteeing freight, Standard Oil was able to turn its position in the volatile refining business into one of impregnable strength.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As the success of Standard Oil became apparent, international competitors also began to gain strength with increasing support from their respective governments, particularly when the use of oil as a fuel with military uses became apparent. Standard Oil remained the dominant player, but was no longer the overwhelming monopoly. Interestingly, the search for oil was stimulated by demand for kerosene rather than motor fuel. Demand for motor fuel started with large-scale power generation, mainly in the naval sector, but took off when the automobile proved itself a viable means of transportation, some 30 years after oil production began in earnest. By the time demand from this quarter was a factor in the market, the Standard Oil Trust was well on the way to its ultimate dissolution in the face of antitrust laws and hostile public opinion.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">So far as the operations of Standard Oil were concerned, the impact the trust had on the market is relatively clear from the stability in the pricing pattern of the main product. The chart in figure 5.9 details the price of kerosene from 1890 to 1917. The pattern is clear. Every time prices moved upward it established a new pricing level. Demand was rising through the period, but such a clear pattern of pricing behaviour is unlikely without some degree of collusion or market control. Combine this with the returns earned by Standard Oil, and it gives a clear picture of the benefits of the position the company had established. The irony was that the antitrust case itself turned less on the evidence of monopoly on a macro level, and more on the ability of the prosecution to paint a picture of individual instances of abuse which in isolation might appear trivial.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There were clear lessons in the case for future organisations which were to find themselves in similar positions. The most obvious are that reliance on macro level arguments will prove insufficient if enough cases of alleged abuse of power can be demonstrated. Successive cases against companies which have reached dominant positions have followed a similar path, although not all those under investigation have necessarily learned the lessons of the past. Microsoft’s behaviour during antitrust investigations in the late 1990s and early 2000s, for example, suggested a lack of familiarity with the history of the consequences of adopting a confrontational attitude to government. The extended survival of AT&amp;T as a single entity, by contrast, rested upon the company’s awareness that its future was dependent upon arriving at an accommodation with the authorities.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style0">W</span><span class="style1">all Street Journal</span><span class="style0">, 11 May 1910.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The dissolution of Standard Oil still left some very large operating businesses. The industry was on a growth path which was to completely overshadow that of kerosene, the original staple product. It took a long time, though, for the industry to recognise the potential of the derived demand from automobiles. In the early years, oil companies were as cautious about prospects as the world at large. Not only did Standard Oil became a giant company in the oil industry, the recycling of its profits made it one of the largest financial concerns in the world and at the same time propelled its bank, which ultimately became Citibank, into the upper leagues of financial institutions.</span> </p>
