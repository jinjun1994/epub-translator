<h1 id="anchor_5110_0"><span class="style1">The broader impact and the future</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">While the technology of the Internet has genuinely transformed the way that many business activities are undertaken, just as the railways did in the 19th century, it has taken many years for these effects to mature and become apparent. The closest historical comparison is probably the radio industry in the years before broadcasting evolved. Everybody knew that the future was going to be different, but nobody at the outset could be sure exactly how, or where the effects would be most keenly felt. For investors, it has taken several years and many false dawns for the enduring winners from the Internet’s arrival to emerge. Some of the biggest winners today are companies, such as Facebook, which did not even exist back in 2000. Others for which investors held out extravagant hopes, such as AOL and MySpace, have in time faltered or disappeared from view.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Internet has spawned scores of individual millionaires, but we are still adding up whether investors in aggregate will prove to have made money from the technology, given how much capital was committed to its development. The past experience of the railways, motor car and aircraft industries is salutory in this respect. Many of the potential gains from these new technologies were competed away through a surfeit of investment, to the benefit of consumers but at the expense of investors. Technological success and corporate failure have been frequent bedfellows during the formative years of companies embracing new technology. Alongside its millionaires the Internet has also helped, as a by-product, to create huge numbers of low skilled, low-paid jobs, widening the disparity of wealth between the owners of companies and those employed lower down the corporate ladder. In this regard there may be more similarities with the Industrial Revolution than many care to admit. The political ramifications of this powerful change in social order remain to play out.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Although we may be in the final stage of the cycle, where ultimate success and failure become apparent for the early entrants, it does not mean that there are no more innovations to come. The ability of consumers to access music, films and news directly at home, for example – initially via personal computers and more recently through smartphones – has turned the media industry inside out. For incumbents in the media industry it has been a case of adapt or die. New entrants have been able to come and build successful franchises of their own more or less from scratch, as the examples of Netflix, Sky and Spotify illustrate. Cinemas have been through a complete revolution of the cycle, with physical film-watching at first seeming to go into terminal decline, only for the trend to be reversed once cinema chains realised the need to make the experience of going out to watch a film more varied and enjoyable.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The industry likely to be most profoundly affected by the emergence of new communications technology is financial services, one of the biggest in the global economy. Banking today is a very different business from what it was even 20 years ago. The disappearance of hundreds of high street bank branches is just one vivid symbol of this change. With the ready accessibility of online and mobile banking, new technology means that hardly anyone needs to visit a physical bank branch any more. This has produced distinct changes in the way that consumers behave, as well as, less beneficially, a thriving new industry of online fraud. In the first edition of the book, I speculated that the Internet would enable a swathe of brand new companies with radically different cost structures to come in and undermine the incumbents, just as Michael Dell was able to do in the personal computer industry before being overtaken by the move to mobility. The problems of out-of-date and inadequate computer systems, the so-called ‘legacy problems’ that exist in many financial services companies, hinder the ability to respond to the new world. One can see how various segments of the finance sector could be attacked by new entrants threatening the fat margins traditionally enjoyed by banks and insurance companies.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">While some new entrants have indeed emerged, to date the degree of change in banking and insurance has been slower than I expected. An increasing regulatory burden, hugely reinforced after the global financial crisis of 2007–08, combined perhaps with customer resistance to change, has restricted the ability of new entrants to take market share from the big banks and insurance companies, which still dominate their sectors. The technology has, however, fundamentally changed the way that these two industries operate. Price transparency has increased, helped by the emergence of price-comparision websites for mortgages, pensions, insurance and other financial products. The Internet has enabled the process of financial intermediation to accelerate. Credit decisions have been largely outsourced to third-party providers. The manufacturer of financial products, whether it be mutual funds or insurance policies, increasingly needs to distribute through a network of third parties rather than having its own direct distribution capability. Many large financial companies have, as expected, struggled to cope with updating and maintaining information about a client base whose information is largely resident on computer systems which have been rendered redundant by Internet technology.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As for the development of new competitors, do not expect to see a wave of new digital banks replacing the incumbents any time soon. More likely is that we will see a gradual process of individual services being picked off by more nimble and attuned competitors. Any service that can be more easily conducted through mobile technology will be attacked. Clearly the higher the margin these services currently achieve, the more attractive they will be for competitors. As an example, it is almost impossible to imagine that the spreads charged for tourist foreign-exchange transactions will exist in ten years’ time. Paying a 10% margin for what is effectively a risk-free transaction is only sustained because of the lack of alternatives. A number of start-up firms are beginning to provide this service at exchange rates much closer to the spot rate historically only available to large institutional customers. There are numerous examples of new specialist entrants, from peer-to-peer lenders to ‘robo’ asset managers. Size and scale are not the barriers to entry they used to be. The point is that business models are being undermined and this will accelerate as the data reservoirs continue to swell and provide ever more accurate insights for targetting clients. Furthermore, the financial crisis holed the reputation of many large financial institutions below the waterline, which has had the effect of reducing that particular barrier to entry. The emergence of cryptocurrencies enabled by the technology of distributed ledgers should be viewed in this context. There are all the characteristics of historic precious metal bubbles in the price performance of bitcoin (for goldbugs read bitbugs), but its ability to garner such favourable comment and support is not unrelated to the reputational damage incurred by the financial industry in the aftermath of the financial crisis.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The point of technology is to create new things and make old things better and cheaper. By definition, making old things better and cheaper must have an impact on existing producers. In addition to its effect on physical products, technology is a huge enabler of buyer choice. For example, the Internet has become an extraordinary and transformative mechanism for price discovery. Consumers who might previously have had imperfect information and been forced to accept price regimes because of proximity or limited availability suddenly have a much wider field to work with. Price-comparison sites are the most obvious manifestation but it is much more pervasive than this. Not only do consumers gain access to more competitive pricing, but the search process itself reveals consumer preferences. Revealed preferences are potentially critical to the pricing decisions of producers, hence the massive expansion in ‘data’ as a valuable commodity.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This data is also being applied to the whole sourcing, manufacturing and logistics/distrubution chain to try and both remove cost and expand reach. The counterpart to the impact on digitisation and its effect on the need for physical storage has been the revolution unfolding in distribution of physical products. Amazon has been at the forefront of developing cutting-edge distribution capability, which has drastically cut the time from customer order to product delivery. This has been enabled by the ability to process and understand customer order patterns, the advances in robotics/recognition and the development of gps and mapping systems. As a consequence we now have a range of products that can be delivered within a very short time which would have been unthinkable even 20 years ago. For the consumer this is a huge improvement even if there is no discernable impact on published economic statistics. The technology improvements have also had an impact on the labour market just as they did during the Industrial Revolution.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">An integral part of the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent development of mass production was the specialisation of tasks. So-called ‘piecework’, where workers were paid according to their output, had a history long preceding the Industrial Revolution. For example, the garment trade in the UK had developed what was known as the ‘sweating system’, where a ‘sweater’ oversaw production. The abject working conditions eventually stimulated legislation to protect workers in what become known as sweatshops. The advent of automation took piecework to new levels with the introduction of more accurate productivity measurement methods such as the ‘Scientific Management’ of Frederick Winslow Taylor. The resulting timed piece-rate system created a work environment where failure to meet output targets ended in penalties or dismissal. Just as the ‘sweating’ system was open to potential abuse, so too was the metered piecework methodology and eventually minimum-wage legislation was brought into place in most developed economies to protect the rights of employees.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Why is this relevant now? The answer is that the ‘gig’ economy is creating vast numbers of jobs effectively based on piecework principles. Not only employee output can be measured, but because of gps so can physical movement. Layered on top of this is the ability of companies to effectively subcontract these task to individuals by treating them as self-employed. All of this has been made easier by the Internet and its associated technological advances. On the assumption that human nature has not changed, it is likely that the power this conveys will tempt some employers to treat their employees or ‘subcontractors’ in a manner which will eventually prove to be unacceptable. More generally, it is likely that the gap in wage-bargaining power between the skilled and unskilled will continue to widen, bringing with it associated social and political issues. The historic backdrop is that when there are such changes in the societal structure, they bring with them unrest and political consequences that cannot be ignored.</span> </p>
