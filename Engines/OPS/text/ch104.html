<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">During this frustrating period in Britain, and the subsequent failure of his attempts to gain financial backing from the government, Marconi sought to generate interest and support for his work by providing public trials of his equipment. These were designed to garner the maximum publicity. Just as Edison and Bell before him had mounted eye-catching public demonstrations and courted the press, so Marconi followed the same path. This included linking up the Royal Yacht with Queen Victoria’s residence on the Isle of Wight and later, in 1899, sending messages 30 miles across the English Channel to France. The main publicity effort, however, was reserved for the United States and the America’s Cup yacht race. This was a very popular event in America. Thousands avidly followed its progress. Teaming up with the</span> <span class="style1">New York Herald</span><span class="style0">, Marconi supplied virtually instantaneous reports on the progress of the race by radio. For the</span> <span class="style1">New York Herald</span><span class="style0">, the fact that the newspaper had gained exclusive use of the new wireless technology to report the race was a news item of almost equal importance to the race itself.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Marconi found himself a news item in his own right and proved remarkably adept at managing his relationship with the newspapers and journals of the time. He was helped by the antagonism of the press towards the telegraph companies, and Western Union in particular. This was an age when America’s largest corporations were frequently vilified in the press and attacked for their trust activities. For the newspapers, this was an especially sensitive point given their reliance on the telegraph companies for their own rapid communication needs. This reliance was particularly marked for transatlantic messages, where the companies exerted a near monopoly through their control of both the cables and telegraph prices.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Whatever justification the arguments against the telegraph companies and their transatlantic rates might have had, there was also self-interest in the condemnations by the press and their overt support of Marconi. Enthusiasm for the radio encouraged journalistic licence, and raised expectations far beyond what the technology had so far been able to deliver. This produced two quite natural reactions. First, the scientific community felt compelled to issue warnings about the limitations of radio, and of Marconi’s work in particular. Secondly, at a time of general stock-market buoyancy, stock promoters were more than happy to try and meet the less-discriminating demand stimulated by the press reports.</span> </p>
