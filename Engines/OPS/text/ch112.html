<h1 id="anchor_3140_0"><span class="style1">RCA – the national champion</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The creation of RCA did not happen overnight. For a number of years the US Navy had tried to extend its dominion over the airwaves and voiced increasing frustration at the absence of a dominant American company. After the outbreak of World War I, the US government sought to maintain its position of neutrality towards the European nations and as such insisted that no military messages be sent from Marconi stations or those from the Telefunken subsidiary Atlantic Communication. However, this censorship proved extremely difficult to enforce. The sinking of the</span> <span class="style1">Lusitania</span> <span class="style0">by German U-boats in 1915, with 1,200 casualties, fanned the flames of public opinion in America. Eventually, after increased tension, America joined the war in 1917.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Immediately the shore stations of Marconi and Atlantic Communication were taken under US Navy control. The US Navy then worked to bring standardisation and quality improvements to the apparatus and stations they had inherited. This involved effectively enforced cross-fertilisation of ideas and a temporary setting aside of commercial secrecy and patents. The navy was particularly concerned to end the primacy of Marconi and this led to the purchase of Federal Telegraph and then the purchase of the Marconi shore stations for $1.6m ($65m). By the end of the war, the US Navy had therefore almost established a dominant position in the wireless industry in America. There remained some areas outwith the navy’s control, such as the Marconi long-distance stations, and these therefore represented the next target.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">By this time, however, there had been a shift in sentiment against direct government involvement in business. During the war the commercial results of government-controlled companies had been poor. Losses had been made despite higher prices, and the public backlash had begun. When the navy sought to increase its control, therefore, it found that the halls of power were not only no longer receptive, but were in fact positively antagonistic. Demands were made that the assets be returned to their previous owners. Faced with such vociferous opposition there remained only one alternative: the creation of a new American-owned company. Moreover, this needed to be concluded with some speed; if Marconi signed an alternator contract with GE the company would almost inevitably regain its dominant position in radio. Preventing this from happening exercised minds at the highest level of government, including the acting secretary to the navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the president, Woodrow Wilson.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The plan for private ownership was supported at the highest level, but it took months of negotiation and review for a workable document to be prepared. Most important of all was the stick wielded by the navy over prospective business for GE and return of equipment to American Marconi. After a number of false starts an agreement was eventually reached whereby the Radio Corporation of America would be created out of American Marconi. Foreign ownership (i.e. British Marconi ownership) would be removed with a gross payment of nearly $3m (roughly $90m) from GE, which in turn would receive shares in the new entity, with the world markets to be divided up between British Marconi and RCA. For British Marconi a sum had been received equivalent to a healthy premium over the previous traded share price and at the same time access to the GE alternator had been assured. For the previously named American Marconi, it now had a new shareholder in GE with access to GE’s developmental work. More importantly, American Marconi in its new guise of RCA no longer had to contend with the enmity of one of its potentially biggest customers.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The formation of RCA also paved the way for resolution of the main barriers to development of the radio. First, there was the long-standing conflict between Fleming’s diode and De Forest’s audion. Now that RCA held the American rights to the diode, it was in a position to negotiate with the licencee of De Forest’s patents. Thus AT&amp;T found a receptive audience when it began negotiations with GE regarding cross-licensing agreements. The circle was completed when Westinghouse joined the group. Westinghouse had acquired the remaining Fessenden patents through its acquisition of the International Radio Telegraph Company and with this the RCA combination had the complete system from continuous-wave transmission to amplified reception. A radio ‘trust’ had effectively been formed largely at the instigation (or certainly with the complicity) of the US government. The government rationale had been principally one of national security and American control of radio technology, partly a long-time legacy of Marconi’s policy of maintaining control of its sales through leasing a service rather than selling equipment. For the commercial interests involved, it was a method of removing a number of the historical constraints associated with the patchwork development of the technology and the fragmented ownership of patent rights.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">However, the one thing that had not changed was the attachment to the notion that the commercial application of wireless technology revolved around point-to-point communication. It was not to be long before the huge opportunity that had been ignored and left in the hands of a minority of enthusiastic amateurs would explode on the market. The interesting parallel for current times would be if a government decided that a particular industry was of national interest and effectively forced a compulsory purchase from foreign owners and turned control over to its national champions. How would foreign investors be likely to react?</span> </p>
