<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The growth of the telephone business, and the returns it brought to the Bell company, acted like blood in the water to a school of sharks. Within three years, 125 companies had been launched, and over the 17-year period when Bell’s invention was supposed to be protected by patent, more than 1,700 telephone companies were formed. Some were genuine challengers to Bell, but most simply set out to violate his patents. Many companies tried to take advantage of the euphoria surrounding the telephone and take money from the investing public. Roughly $225m ($18bn) was raised by these companies, although few ever managed to launch a telephone business. Some were straightforward scams. One company raised $15m (over $1bn) without putting together any capital or holding any <span id="anchor_1364_126"></span>patents.<a href="ch51.html#anchor_1512_0">²⁶</a> The new companies could be split broadly into two types: those that claimed to have some precedence over the Bell patents, and those that simply ignored them, either in the hope that they would not be pursued for their patent infringement, or that any legal process would be so protracted as to outrun the life of the patent.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the former camp, the claimants ranged from the obviously frivolous to the potentially serious. Many candidates presented themselves as the ‘true’ inventor of the telephone. Professor Amos Emerson Dolbear, for example, had a reasonable claim in that he was a serious scientist who had been conducting parallel work to Bell. Dolbear claimed an improvement to a telephone based on the work of the German inventor Philipp Reis. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts, the apparatus upon which the claim was based refused to work successfully in a courtroom demonstration. As a consequence, in early 1883, the action of the American Bell Telephone Company against the Dolbear Electric Telephone Company was upheld, effectively forcing the latter out of business. If Dolbear had a reasonable claim based on his scientific pedigree and the work he had conducted, there were others with substantially less foundation.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">An amateur inventor called Daniel Drawbaugh claimed to have constructed a working telephone before Bell, despite the fact that in court he could not explain how he had come to make the invention. Even so, anti-monopolist sentiment allowed the case to drag on for some time and it reached the Supreme Court before being settled in Bell’s favour. Drawbaugh’s backing came from a group of investors who had filed for a patent on his behalf, using this to raise $5m (over $400m) in capital to form the People’s Telephone Company. Drawbaugh may have been a poor backwoodsman, but he was to profit personally, as were his backers, from the long drawn-out case. (Drawbaugh was later to claim to have also invented the radio before Marconi.) In New York, a Staten Island candlemaker named Antonio Meucci also laid claim to precedence over Bell. The court examinations of his claim pointed merely to his success in non-electric instrumentation, involving a taut wire stretched between two tin <span id="anchor_1368_165"></span>cans.<a href="ch51.html#anchor_1513_0">²⁷</a> Despite the flimsy nature of the claim, it too had been used to underpin the formation of a company, The Globe Company. The need to resist legal claims, however flimsy, was a financial drain on the Bell companies, and also took up a great deal of management time. Shareholders needed to be reassured. Many cases made it to the US Supreme Court, where the Bell patent was invariably upheld, but this process took five years – sometimes longer – to complete.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In many more instances, claims were knowingly based on flimsy scientific evidence, to put it kindly. The most notorious claim was from an entity called the Pan-Electric Company, which was launched in the mid-1880s and capitalised at $5m (over $400m). The basis of the company was the claim by a Mr Brown to have invented the telephone, a claim later described as: “about one per cent inspiration, ninety-nine per cent tracing <span id="anchor_1370_72"></span>paper”.<a href="ch51.html#anchor_1514_0">²⁸</a> The assets of the company were paper drawings of the telephone, later shown to be tracings of Bell’s patents! The backers distributed shares in the company to prominent politicians. Augustus Garland, who subsequently became attorney general under President Grover Cleveland, received 10% of the outstanding shares. Garland filed for an annulment of Bell’s patents on the basis that they had been obtained by fraud and bribery. Backing up this assertion was an affidavit from the patent office official, Wilber Zenas, who recanted his previous sworn testimony, claiming that he had been afflicted by alcoholism at the time he granted the original patent.</span> </p>
