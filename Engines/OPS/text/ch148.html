<p><span class="style0">By the early 1980s, the industry had almost evolved to a new structure. The number of producers diminished dramatically as the competitive pressure from IBM and Apple forced rivals out of business. While former high-growth companies such as Osborne Computer Corporation went to the wall, other companies with very different business models emerged. Rather than seek to develop their own computer, these companies produced machines that were broadly the same as the industry standard (the IBM PC) but cheaper and better in key respects. This was standard practice – the IMSAI had swiftly followed the Altair – and IBM clones swiftly followed the launch of its PC.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The most notable company to emerge was formed by three ex-Texas Instruments employees, with financial backing from Ben Rosen. Compaq built an equivalent PC from scratch and quickly garnered a following, with sales in excess of $100m in the first year. Compaq had not copied IBM’s technology; it had simply recreated it, thus making it relatively immune from litigation. Others followed suit, and soon it was possible to buy or license the information necessary to create an IBM-compatible PC. This was to change the industry to one where the importance of brand name diminished, while efficient production and rapid incorporation of the latest chip technology proved decisive. It also meant that while after-sales service remained important, particularly for the business user, sales and distribution could take place through virtually any channel.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The computer industry exhibited very strong growth, but this did not mean that it was immune from either the economic cycle or from the impact of new competition. As the industry developed, so too did the capital commitment associated with the production of personal computers. Just as the automobile industry had gravitated to a mass production cost-based model, so the personal computer industry required an ever more expensive infrastructure to maintain competitive advantage. This meant that economies of scale became increasingly important.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Equally, while growth remained strong as the market expanded, a key feature of the market expansion was the continuing fall in the price of the product. This was not deflation in the sense of overall price declines. It was simply that the leaps in technology translated into ever lower unit costs and the competitive structure forced most of these to be passed on to the consumer. These leaps in technology also shortened the lifecycle of the product, and made the penalty for not keeping up a high one. Product obsolescence could easily translate into financial distress (for a company with a wide product portfolio) and bankruptcy (for a single-product company). At the root of this industry dynamic was the increasingly non-proprietary nature of the personal computer’s core. During the 1990s it was almost a hybrid industry, combining the characteristics of both growth and commodity cyclicality. In other words, despite the fact that it had strong underlying growth rates, it was not like, for example, the pharmaceutical industry, the products of which remain relatively immune from the effects of economic downturn. Once the IBM PC ‘standard’ hardware quickly became firmly established, the main differentiating factor proved to be what the machines were capable of doing, and the ease with which these functions could be accomplished. Although MS-DOS became the industry standard operating system, this did not mean it was necessarily the best system. That accolade went to the Macintosh computer, produced by Apple as a follow-up to the committee-designed, and ill-fated, Apple III. The Macintosh represented a significant upgrade in user experience, distinguishing it from the IBM product and its clones. The genesis of the Macintosh lay in a visit to the Xerox PARC facility by Steve Jobs.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) facility had continued pioneering research work (e.g. GUI, objective-oriented programming, electronic paper etc.) demonstrated by Doug Engelbart 15 years before but had done relatively little to develop it commercially. The facility had been specifically set up as a research centre, and although Xerox did seek to enter the personal computer market in the early 1980s, it was to do so with a machine which failed to take advantage of PARC’s knowledge base and was unable either to take market share from Apple or to compete with IBM’s offering. The impact that PARC had was paradoxical in the sense that its concepts and research were to find embodiment not in a Xerox product, but in the product of competitor companies such as Apple and Microsoft. In return for allowing Xerox to invest in Apple, Jobs and his team negotiated visits to the PARC facility to see what they had been working on. PARC had not only developed the ethernet to link office machines, but also had working models of computers that used a mouse for navigation and for moving documents and text around the screen. Jobs also saw a GUI with overlapping documents on a screen and programs represented as icons.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The visits to PARC in 1979 showed Jobs the future. He changed the direction of development at Apple with the express aim of producing a commercial version of what he had seen at PARC. The result was the Macintosh computer. The Apple Mac, launched in 1984, met the requirements set by Jobs and was lauded by the technical press. It was not, however, a commercial success in its early years and the tension and financial stress this created led to a showdown between Jobs and the CEO, John Sculley, which culminated in Jobs’s departure in May 1985.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Apple Mac faced two endemic problems of the early personal computer market. Firstly, it proved to be underpowered, despite carrying double the ‘standard’ memory. The time that elapsed before sufficient memory could be provided to cope with the computer’s needs was enough to dampen enthusiasm for the machine. Secondly, it was not easy to write software for; as a consequence, far fewer applications were available for it compared to the IBM industry standard. These problems were not insurmountable, and after posting losses for the first time in its history, Jobs’s machine was to propel the company to a highly profitable phase, albeit in his absence. The impact of the Mac was further enhanced by additional software for graphics and printing which effectively gave Apple a lock on the emerging desktop publishing (DTP) market.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">That the Apple Mac and its successors embodied the future articulated in the late 1960s by Engelbart was not lost on others in the industry. Gates had visited Jobs at Apple and seen the prototype Macintosh in 1981. Microsoft grasped the superiority of the front end provided by the Mac and in it the ultimate demise as a standalone entity of Microsoft’s cash cow, the operating system MS-DOS. Understanding this, it had for some time been working on its own GUI; indeed, Microsoft had announced the product, named Windows, before the Apple Mac launch. The product itself, though, did not arrive for a further two years.</span> </p>
