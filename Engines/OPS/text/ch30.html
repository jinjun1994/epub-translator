<h1 id="anchor_939_0"><span class="style1">A game of monopoly: the fight for Erie</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As an individual who had made a fortune by undermining publicly granted monopolies or subsidies, Vanderbilt was well aware of the benefits that accrue when competition is absent. It had long been recognised that railroads were a potentially natural monopoly. Stephenson, who built the</span> <span class="style1">Rocket</span><span class="style0">, noted that the capital requirements favoured a monopoly structure. As Vanderbilt extended his network, he took control of smaller railroad companies. He also found himself subjected to the same treatment he had dealt out to the steamship lines and on more than one occasion he was forced to make payments to prevent competition. The method he used to pay for his high-priced acquisitions was simply to issue more New York Company paper to pay for his purchases.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Vanderbilt continually sought to protect his pricing power as his network expanded. In this regard, the Erie Railroad was by far the largest thorn in his flesh. Upon gaining control of New York Central, his network extended from the New York terminus in Harlem to Albany through the Hudson River Railroad and the New York Central to Buffalo. Other interests took his line to the point where he could almost connect with Chicago. To complete the link, he needed the Michigan Southern, which would also give him access to its Chicago terminal. Piece by piece, he had almost assembled a link from New York to Chicago. Vanderbilt was well aware of the dangers of price competition in such a capital-intensive business. In this regard, the biggest threat emanated from the Erie Railroad. Vanderbilt’s attempts to neutralise this threat led to one of the most Machiavellian episodes in financial history and brought him into conflict with another arch speculator of the time, Jay Gould.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Vanderbilt was well aware of the importance of the New York to Chicago route, as were all his principal competitors. The biggest threat to his gaining control of the Michigan and Southern route lay with the Erie Railroad. In order to avoid difficulties, Vanderbilt entered into negotiations with Daniel Drew, his longtime adversary. An agreement was swiftly reached which was intended to lead to Vanderbilt obtaining control of Erie. Thus began the saga of ‘the fight for Erie’ which in many was to symbolise all that was wrong with the stock market and investment at the time. Features of the battle included profiteering, share price manipulation and anti-competitive practices.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">At the time there was no clear unitary legal framework within either US company or securities law. Different states vied with each other, and even within states there was potential for conflict. New York’s judicial system conferred equal authority on each of its 33 Supreme Court justices. This was the ‘Tammany Hall’ era of Boss Tweed, when political favours were common, almost to the point of being a publicly traded good. Such was the influence and notoriety of William Tweed and his cohort that ‘Tammany Hall’ has become synonymous with corruption in local government. Both Vanderbilt and Drew had substantial experience of paying for Tweed’s power and influence over transportation franchises. Protection or support from the law was usually simply a matter of the amount one was willing to pay.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It helped that overseas investors owned a substantial proportion of shares in the railroad companies. The owners took little active part in the companies and voted few of these shares, the majority being left as proxies with local brokers. This conferred great power on the proxy holder, whose interests rarely coincided with those of the beneficial owners. Second, the ‘watering down’ of holdings by equity issuance should have been prevented by the General Railroad Act of 1850, which restricted the issuance of new shares. A huge gap was left, though, in that the railroads were allowed to issue convertible bonds if their purpose was railroad construction. This enabled the unscrupulous to issue bonds ostensibly for that purpose, but which they later converted into equity.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There was little in the way of legal protection for shareholders, and what protection there was could easily be swayed by financial inducement. Finally, those with the biggest financial exposure and hence most likely to be harmed – foreign shareholders – did little to protect their interests, and, by their own negligence, conferred additional power on those most willing to abuse it. It was little wonder that, in such conditions, and with such potential rewards, there emerged a new breed of ruthless personalities, of the type who became known as the ‘robber barons’.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Erie Railroad was an unlikely candidate to feature in one of the most notorious financial episodes in American history. It was originally charted in 1832 to build a connection between the ocean traffic of the Great Lakes and New York City. It was completed in 1851, but as a result of poor construction, poor linkages and poor routing its share price had fallen from $33 to $9 in 1859 and the company went into receivership. Recovery came with reorganisation, acquisition of better port linkages, access to the coal fields of Pennsylvania and a tie-up with the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad which brought with it valuable oil freight. The Civil War boosted freight levels, and as a consequence, the route’s prosperity.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Much of the credit for the recovery and the accompanying debt reductions was due to Nathaniel Marsh, who had taken over as president of the railroad at the time of its receivership. In 1864, however, Marsh died suddenly and two new shareholders came to the fore. Daniel Drew had been investing in the company since 1854, when he loaned the company $1.5m, and he subsequently became treasurer. Drew used his position, often financed by the treasury of the company itself, to profit from short selling the stock whenever the opportunity presented itself. The company’s history therefore was one of poor construction, an appalling accident record and persistent stock market manipulation by insiders, even before Vanderbilt’s arrival on the scene.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Despite its chequered history, Vanderbilt was sufficiently concerned about the threat to the profitability of his New York Central line to be drawn into an agreement with Daniel Drew to gain control of the Erie Railroad. In 1866 he began purchasing stock in Erie and was soon confidently announcing his intention to incorporate it into his network. Despite his success with the Harlem and Hudson railroad operators, however, Vanderbilt quickly discovered that his enemies had learned lessons from previous stock market battles with him. Other than Vanderbilt, the main protagonists were Drew and his associates, Jay Gould and Jim Fisk, and a Boston consortium headed by John Eldridge. Vanderbilt probably believed he had control by virtue of the stock he owned and his agreement with Daniel Drew. Unfortunately for him, Drew reneged on his agreement. This may have been caused by a desire to recoup losses from previous failed bear raids on Vanderbilt, or simply an irresistible opportunity. Whatever the reasons, Drew flooded the market with stock.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This stock came from a deal where Gould and Fisk had bought a small railroad company and leased its assets to Erie for an inflated price. Payment was in Erie convertible bonds, which were then converted into stock and sold to Vanderbilt. The Eldridge group had bought stock in Erie in a bid to persuade the company to fund a road between Boston and the Hudson River. Vanderbilt entered into a secret agreement with the Eldridge group to guarantee $4m of their debts on condition that they voted with him to remove Drew. Outmanoeuvred, Drew capitulated and sought to mend fences with Vanderbilt. Although he temporarily resigned, in 1867 two of his contemporaries, Gould and Fisk, were appointed to the Board.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The peace was short-lived. Vanderbilt called a meeting of the New York Central and Erie Railroad directors to pool traffic and set prices, only to find that Gould and Fisk, the Erie directors under Drew’s control, had voted against him. Even worse, Erie started negotiations with Michigan Southern and at the same time issued $10m of convertible bonds to allow further dumping of Erie stock. This meant that despite all Vanderbilt’s stock purchases, and his success in obtaining foreign owners’ proxies from local brokers, he still did not have control. His holdings were being diluted by the day against the backdrop of a falling Erie share price. Unable to stop Drew and his cohorts directly, Vanderbilt sought assistance from the law. New York Supreme Court Judge George Barnard, a member of the ‘Tweed <span id="anchor_961_134"></span>Ring’<a href="ch36.html#anchor_1146_0">¹⁰</a> issued a series of injunctions on his behalf, requiring the return of 25% of the recently issued securities, $3m of convertibles and the cessation of any further issues. As a result, the Erie share price rose from $50 to $84, a welcome movement for Vanderbilt who now owned 200,000 shares.</span> </p>
