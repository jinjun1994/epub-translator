<h1 id="anchor_919_0"><span class="style1">Towards a rail network</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Vanderbilt’s foray into railroads began with the purchase of stock in the New York and Harlem Railroad. The nature of investment in those times can be gauged through reference to the events that were to unfold. Vanderbilt began buying stock at $9 per share and continued to buy even</span> <span class="style1">after</span> <span class="style0">he had obtained control at prices of more than $50 per share (for reasons that will become clear later). Once he had control, he paid large sums of money to members of the New York Common Council to grant him a streetcar franchise between Battery and <span id="anchor_921_97"></span>Broadway.<a href="ch36.html#anchor_1142_0">⁶</a> When news of the franchise emerged, the share price of Harlem jumped to more than ten times what Vanderbilt had paid.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This did not go without a response. George Law, a rival of Vanderbilt’s, persuaded politicians of the New York State Legislature to claim an exclusive right to award such franchises and announce its intention to revoke Harlem’s franchise. In tandem with this, a short selling operation was mounted by (among others) Daniel Drew, a noted bear raider of the time. Stock was sold short at $100 per share, with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price. Unfortunately for the short sellers, Vanderbilt had employed his capital to pick up as much as he could of the available shares in the company. He then executed a perfect short squeeze. With no stock available in the marketplace, and insufficient stock to deliver against the short selling obligations, Drew et al were forced to repurchase stock from Vanderbilt at a share price of $179 per share. This manoeuvre gave rise to a profit to Vanderbilt, and an equal loss to his opponents, of over $1m ($80m).</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This pattern was repeated a number of times as Vanderbilt sought to expand his railroad network. His next acquisition target was the Hudson River Railroad, which ran parallel to his own on the other bank of the river. Again the local politicians had to be bought off to gain authorisation for the railroad. Again the stock price advanced as expectations of success rose, and again Daniel Drew orchestrated a large short-selling campaign, in conjunction with rumours that the politicians were to reverse their judgement. Hudson River Railroad stock, having jumped from $25 to $150, plunged. Vanderbilt only survived by organising a pool of funds from associates and using the $5m (nearly $500m) to buy all the Harlem stock which was being offered. Without this pool of capital to back him, the bear raid would have succeeded. As it was, he again achieved a short squeeze which ruined his opponents.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the years that followed, Vanderbilt steadily built out his railroad empire. Those who would not willingly sell out, he squeezed through his operations, deliberately disrupting services and using any number of ploys to bring the owners into line with his wishes. For example, when the owners of the New York Central resisted his embrace, Vanderbilt severed connections on freight and passenger traffic, forcing passengers to walk across the frozen river to <span id="anchor_927_73"></span>Albany.<a href="ch36.html#anchor_1143_0">⁷</a> Eventually the owners of the New York Central capitulated and a new amalgamated railroad company, whose operations ran from the eastern seaboard to the Great Lakes, was born. The owners intimidated by Vanderbilt in this way were not powerless shareholders, but included the likes of the Astors and Edward Cunard.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In May 1869, after he managed to merge all his railroad interests into New York Central, Vanderbilt recapitalised the company. Part of this recapitalisation involved the issuance of stock. ‘Watering down’, the practice of diluting existing shareholders by issuing new stock, was a common practice (or affliction) of the time. Vanderbilt and his son-in-law physically carried away the enormous sum of $6m (over $450m) as part of the <span id="anchor_929_69"></span>recapitalisation.<a href="ch36.html#anchor_1144_0">⁸</a> Estimates of the total amount of ‘watering down’ conducted by Vanderbilt in the New York Central run as high as $50m ($3.8bn). The dangers of investing in railroads for the outside investor were well understood at the time, but the level of optimism about expected returns was such that this was insufficient to deter the flow of both domestic and foreign capital to finance their expansion.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As in Britain, the expansion of the railroad system in the US changed the clocks. In America, where distances were multiples of those in Britain, the time problem was that much greater. Illinois alone had nearly 30 incremental measures of time and Wisconsin nearly 40. In 1883 the American Railway Association created four time zones and time shifted from “God’s time” to “Vanderbilt’s <span id="anchor_931_64"></span>time”.<a href="ch36.html#anchor_1145_0">⁹</a></span> </p>
