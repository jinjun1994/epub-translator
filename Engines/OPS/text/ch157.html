<p><span class="style0">Funding from ARPA produced a consortium of academic institutions who would work together to build a computing network. The embryonic ARPANET was some distance from the Internet of today. Licklider’s communication problem still had to be solved. Fundamental to this was the mental leap required to split timesharing concepts from those of networking. The problem with timesharing was that it caused users to be very protective of their allocation of time on the computer, and naturally resistant to anything that might encroach upon it, such as new networking languages and protocols. The solution was to create a network of linked minicomputers which would handle all these tasks and tie the individual mainframes to these interface machines.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Each institution therefore had to work out how to communicate with its minicomputer, known as an interface message processor (IMP). The solution was an elegant one, which split timesharing and networking, allowing users to network with increased computing power. By the late 1960s, building upon work sponsored by the Department of Defense at the Rand Corporation, and concurrent work at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK, it was possible to use ‘packet switching’ technology to move information around a network without having to rely on a single unbroken series of computer links. In 1968, the Boston-based consultancy Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) won the contract to develop interface message processors. BBN had been heavily involved in US government defence work in the past and also had a historic relationship with Licklider. Less than ten months after winning the contract, BBN installed the first IMP at UCLA and the second at the Stanford Research Institute. Subsequent nodes, or access points, were added in 1969 and the four host institutions – UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, UC Santa Barbara and the University of Utah – linked their machines to create the ARPANET. This would be the forerunner of today’s Internet, although at the time few suspected the uses to which such networking would eventually be put.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The second key piece of work to emerge from ARPA was sponsorship conducted at Stanford by Doug Engelbart. Engelbart had worked on the ARPANET project, as well as focusing on a wide range of tools and techniques for information manipulation and transfer. Initially Engelbart had been funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and this resulted in a paper discussing interactive computing. In 1963 Engelbart published: ‘A Conceptual Framework for the Augmentation of Man’s Intellect’, which focused on the need to design computer systems and tools to complement human capabilities. He set out an illustrative general system referred to as H-LAM/T (Human using Language, Artifacts, and Methodology in which he is Trained). This proposed system built on the vision of Vannevar Bush and pulled together the various strands of development in human computer interfaces and the concepts of linking associated text as laid out in ‘memex’. Development of the concepts in this paper was funded by the ARPA IPTO under Licklider.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The culmination of this work was a presentation in San Francisco in December 1968 later dubbed ‘the mother of all demos’. At the presentation, Engelbart used a mouse to navigate the screen, projected so that the audience could take in the full detail of the mixture of text, graphics and video. It was effectively a multimedia display incorporating expandable and embedded text with links to additional documents, all this between two users in different locations. In this one remarkable presentation, many of the tools that were to take decades to refine and become usable were shown to a stunned audience. The presentation led to a research project known as oNLine System (NLS), which continued until 1977 when financial considerations caused Stanford to cut its funding.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Engelbart moved to a company called Tymshare, but many of his staff were recruited by Xerox, which had set up a new research centre at Palo Alto, named the Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC. The technology and concepts that emerged from PARC were to find their way back into mainstream computing, but (as we saw in chapter 9) only via a circuitous route and through the opening of a completely new market segment, the personal computer. The development of the personal computer would take place separately from the Internet, although as prices fell and functionality increased, it became the equivalent of the telephone handset, linking telephone cables but for purposes of data transmission.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Engelbart was not alone in following up Bush’s vision. In the early 1960s a graduate sociology student at Harvard, Ted Nelson, began to recognise the latent power of computing for information storage and retrieval. By the mid-1960s Nelson had coined the term ‘hypertext’ to describe the linkages first outlined by Bush, although Nelson’s conception had moved some distance beyond that of either Bush or Engelbart. Nelson would pursue these ideas, through Project Xanadu, a software development project, and texts such as</span> <span class="style1">Dream Machines</span> <span class="style0">(1974) and</span> <span class="style1">Literary Machines</span> <span class="style0">(1987). On each occasion, the Xanadu software was described as ‘forthcoming/imminent’ but, as with Babbage in chapter 8, it always seemed to be postponed or shelved in favour of new improvements and further developments. One should not minimise the importance of Nelson’s ideas, despite the fact that they failed to find full expression. He contributed to the evolution of the Internet just as did Bush and Engelbart. Products such as Apple’s Hypercard software, Lotus Notes, and the Mosaic Internet graphical interface, had their genesis in Nelson’s publications and presentations. Whether his original conception of hypertext as a two-way linkage will ever resurface, as Babbage’s ideas did, remains to be seen.</span> </p>
