<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">If the valuations attributed to many TMT companies in the bubble era were patently absurd, it did not mean that no new enterprises of real value were being created. As so often in the past, out of the wreckage of the stock market crash some survivors prospered. New companies that nobody had heard of before emerged to create businesses which in some cases, such as Google and Facebook, have become industry titans in their own right. To give a flavour of the transformative effect of what happened since the dot-com crash, at the end of 2016 the combined market capitalisation of three such companies alone – Google, Facebook and Amazon – exceeded that of 50% of the top 100 companies listed in the UK. It was also equivalent to roughly 20% of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index, which includes companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Cisco.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There is nothing ephemeral or illusory about the success that these companies have enjoyed. The impressive rewards earned by shareholders in the first two of these companies fairly reflect the underlying growth in sales and profits they have achieved. Amazon is a slightly different case. Despite its remarkable transition from bookseller to global retail platform, and its subsequent move into the creation of digital content and provision of cloud services, the jury is still out on the profit margin that will finally be delivered on the company’s incredible growth in revenues. Nobody can dispute, however, how impressive the company has been in executing the development of its business.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It is worth noting in passing another echo from previous technology bubbles, which is the prosaic nature of many of the businesses that the Internet revolution spawned. When the Royal Mail introduced the ‘Uniform Penny Post’ in 1840 it coincided with the growth of the railroads. This happy conjunction allowed the Welsh entrepreneur, Pryce Pryce-Jones, to launch the first modern mail-order business in 1861. In the US, Tiffany’s mail-order</span> <span class="style1">Blue Book</span> <span class="style0">was created in 1845, with the Montgomery Ward business following a similar path in 1872 and Sears in 1888. For the Penny Post/railways and mail order, read the Internet and Amazon. Similarly, inducements for consumers to reveal their preferences to advertisers and producers have a history which long predates the birth of Google and Facebook.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">Advertising: the tectonic plates have already shifted</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The narrative of how the Internet has developed follows – and builds on – earlier technology breakthroughs in other ways too. The global interconnected network it has created is a natural successor to the telegram, telephone, radio and television. The telegram transmitted short written notes from one individual to another. The telephone enabled one-to-one verbal communication. The radio transmitted audio content from a single person to many listeners. Television did the same for visual content. The Internet now enables interaction in all these media to move from the many to the many. The data implications of this are enormous. Now it is possible to build a record of consumer preferences based on actual activity, operating in real-time. Companies can immediately monitor consumer behaviour in response to variations in pricing and product.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The first iteration of this has been the updating of the traditional model of market research. The historic model of consumer surveys or interviewers on the streets offering vouchers/cakes to their victims as an incentive or reward has been replaced by ‘free’ access to highly sophisticated and powerful tools such as search, email and social networking. Enabled by the ubiquitous development of the Internet, consumers have become avid users – to the extent that many would be lost without the ability to ‘Google’ a question or ‘Facebook’ a friend. Notwithstanding the level of penetration of these tools, it is revealing that they share a common characteristic: consumers cannot be persuaded to pay for the services directly. In this sense the providers can be termed ‘by-product’ companies; companies whose revenue derives not from the service they provide but from the information which their usage creates.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">While users may not be willing to pay for the services directly, they do pay significant amounts indirectly through the value of the information that their use provides. Advertisers have been very quick to realise the power of the Internet and revenues have shifted swiftly to the ‘new’ medium to the point that the rate of growth is already slowing. The initial losers were the ‘old’ medium stalwarts such traditional newsprint-based advertisers but TV has now also begun to lose share. Growth in online advertising revenues will continue but the field will become more competitive as other ‘by-product’ companies such as Twitter and Snapchat seek to access the same revenues.</span> </p>

<h2><span class="style1">Consumers are the biggest gainers so far…</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For consumers the Internet is an ideal tool for price comparison. It is instant and widespread. As a consequence a multiplicity of price-comparison websites have emerged across a wide range of product types. These sites make it difficult for producers to discriminate on price between different consumer groups and they threaten the survival of inefficient retailers. The irony here is that branding becomes an enemy of price discrimination for the retailer. Where the product is clearly defined, so long as the consumer is convinced of its authenticity the key question becomes its price. Hence the greater the homogeneity of any product, the more likely it will become prone to price competition. This improved pricing information puts the consumer in a much stronger position.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For producers, on the other hand, increased insight into consumer behaviour helps both to identify potential new customers and to determine the effectiveness of price discrimination. An obvious example is premium pricing during periods of shortage, one which Uber has already sought to exploit with differential pricing during peak periods.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The effect of these competing forces appears thus far to have been to benefit consumers more than producers. The difference between what consumers wish to pay and what they actually pay, what economists call ‘consumer surplus’, is moving in their favour. Although this has the effect of lowering prices it is not necessarily deflationary. It is simply that inefficiencies in the distribution system are being eroded by the availability of better information. Combined with improvements in logistics/delivery, it is devastating for those companies whose existence depended upon these inefficiencies. The wholesale destruction of segments of the retail sector is testament to this.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Whereas the early years of the Internet revolution were largely about the shift from offline to online retailing, and associated changes in the source of advertising revenues, recent trends have increasingly been about the rise of digital distribution and more efficient asset utilisation. Distribution of digital content is an obvious and straightforward business proposition that depends mainly (a) upon improving data compression and (b) increasing bandwidth. The insatiable demand for accessibility has driven the roll out of fibre optic cable and the advent of standards such as DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) to add fixed-line capacity for both direct access and as a backup for mobile access. Mobile technology has itself moved on apace. The connectivity afforded by 2g is considered prehistoric and the 3g dream of the TMT bubble has swiftly moved on to 4g, with the roll out of 5g expected by 2020. Voice, data and video content are being augmented by ever more sophisticated locational-based services. The number of devices connected to the Internet is rising sharply and this will soon be joined by the widespread adoption of in-car connectivity. It is unlikely that the pace of development of either mobile or fixed-line will slow.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">By whatever circuitous route, therefore, the vision of Vannevar Bush looks close to being realised. The so-called ‘memex’, where information was stored in a manner that better reflected human needs, is being achieved through the use of links, algorithms and artificial intelligence. The intuitive way that the Internet can now be interrogated has led to an explosion in its use, making it indispensable to modern life. That use has created a massive amount of new information, so-called ‘big data’, which can itself be interrogated to learn about human behaviour and improve decision-making. The economic value embedded in big data is huge. It has already revolutionised the retail sector and is increasingly adding to the richness and convenience of everyday life. Analytical techniques such as artificial intelligence have moved from the rarified sphere of academia to everyday use, allowing repeating data patterns to be identified with relative ease. The ‘professions’ will inevitably adopt this technology to simplify and enhance analysis in areas as diverse as the law, finance and medicine. Many jobs which were historically deemed as highly skilled will face the intrusion of numeric- and logic-based applications which can do the job cheaper and better.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Despite this, there remain areas where progress has been painstakingly slow. Since World War II financial services have taken an ever greater share of GDP and this trend accelerated after 1980. Advances in technology and communications, not to mention scale, have produced little evidence of cost reductions for end users. Indeed, on some estimates the “unit cost of financial intermediation appears as high today as it was around <span id="anchor_4753_69"></span>1900”.<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4891_0">¹⁰⁶</a> This is not to say that there have been no beneficiaries. “In 1980 the typical financial services employee earned about the same wages as his counterpart in other industries; by 2006, employees in financial services earned an average of 70% <span id="anchor_4753_110"></span>more.”<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4892_0">¹⁰⁷</a> This has not gone unnoticed and some, such as Lord Turner, former head of the UK Financial Services Authority, have suggested that “it is possible to extract rents from the real economy rather than deliver economic <span id="anchor_4753_147"></span>value”.<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4893_0">¹⁰⁸</a> Thus we have a position where technology is an increasing threat, traditional customers have lost trust, costs have escalated and regulators are suspicious of the merits of incumbents. It is hard to believe this is not the next major battleground between incumbents and challenger firms. To an extent this is already being anticipated by financial markets with new private start-ups achieving staggering implied valuations.</span> </p>
