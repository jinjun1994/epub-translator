<h1 id="anchor_518_0"><span class="style1">New and updated material</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For this second revised edition I had an opportunity to revisit the events of 1999–2000 with the added benefit of a rearview mirror. It is pleasing to be able to report that most (but not every single one) of my contemporaneous thoughts on how the Internet bubble would play out were vindicated. ‘This time it’s different’ did not turn out to be any more true than before. Anyone with an understanding of previous technology episodes should have been able to navigate this mania successfully, although many investors and entrepreneurs did not.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">I have also taken the opportunity of this new edition to add some further analysis of how the Internet evolved in practice over the 15 years since the previous edition. As with railways and electricity, it turns out that the visionaries who predicted that the Internet would transform the social and economic landscape were right. We now truly live in a connected world, in which information travels seamlessly around the world, and the daily operations of myriad types of business have been made more efficient through adopting the networks and communication tools of the online world.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">And yet in the stock market, which embraced the arrival of technology, media and telecoms companies with such wild enthusiasm in the late 1990s, the story has been somewhat different. Only a handful of the companies which commanded lofty market capitalisations during the mania have come close to justifying their valuations. The great majority of market comets which lit up the sky back then simply crashed back to earth, many of them worthless. It took more than ten years for the quoted technology sector to regain its prior peak. The same was true for the Nasdaq index.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the last five years, however, we have seen a strong renaissance, with the US stock market being led to new highs by newly powerful global companies which have emerged as the biggest winners of the transformative technology investors were so excited about in 2000. Ironically, two of the biggest – Facebook and Google – barely existed at the time of the bubble, and few investors foresaw that search and social media would create two natural monopolies that dominate the world of digital advertising. In this respect, too, the Internet bubble echoes earlier technological episodes.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">I comment on these two companies and other sectors in more depth in chapters 10 and 11, both of which have been extensively revised to take account of recent developments. It is ironic that we are once again hearing the world ‘bubble’ on investors’ lips, referring to the strong performance and lofty valuations of new technology companies – not just Internet-related businesses, but those operating in other fields such as biotechnology, automation and transport. Do these new businesses, many still unquoted and capital-light, require a new way of thinking and new types of analysis?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Living through the TMT bubble and further subsequent turns of the market cycle has stimulated me to consider further areas for research into this fascinating topic. One question in particular intrigues me: Is it possible to generate substantial value as a professional investor not by identifying and backing the winners of each technological revolution – which history shows is notoriously hard – but instead by identifying and betting against those companies which are bound to lose?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The research that underpins this book strongly suggests that this could be a profitable and less risky approach. So many sectors of the economy look vulnerable to new and disruptive technology – retailing, financial services, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, to name but four. Are the coming phases of disruption so obvious that we can spot the failures in advance? This will be the subject of a series of sectoral studies – and in due course, I hope, the subject of my next book.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Winston Churchill, the great wartime leader, is said to have commented that one should never let a good crisis go to waste. Although it was a difficult professional experience at the time, the stock market drama that led me to produce the first edition of this book has more than repaid the many hours of effort that went into it. The world moves on, however, and just as soon as one has absorbed the lessons of the last market hiatus, it is time to turn one’s attention to the next – the comforting difference being the hope that recent experience can be banked and turned to profitable use as the cycle turns.</span> </p>
