<h1 id="anchor_3807_0"><span class="style1">Creating an industry</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In terms of market impact, it was Ed Roberts’s failing calculator self-assembly company, MITS, which set the early pulses racing. As the calculator price wars decimated the industry, Roberts was faced with two options. He could watch his company slip into liquidation, or he could develop a new product which had some protection from the vicious price competition. He chose the latter course. Like all new product launches, success depends in part upon the product itself. However, marketing is also vital. If a product is in any sense ‘groundbreaking’, as Roberts intended his to be, marketing moves from being important to critical. During the mid-1970s, a number of magazines were avidly read by computer disciples. One of these was</span> <span class="style1">Radio Electronics</span> <span class="style0">(</span><span class="style1">RE</span><span class="style0">), another</span> <span class="style1">Popular Electronics</span> <span class="style0">(</span><span class="style1">PE</span><span class="style0">). In July 1974</span> <span class="style1">RE</span> <span class="style0">published a feature about a computer called the Mark-8, constructed around the Intel 8008 chip. Roberts had examined the possibility of using the 8008, but was dissuaded by the microprocessor’s limitations. These limitations did not dampen the public reception to the Mark-8, but did fatally undermine its commercial appeal.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">One by-product of the</span> <span class="style1">RE</span> <span class="style0">article on the Mark-8 was that it forced its rival magazine,</span> <span class="style1">Popular Electronics</span><span class="style0">, to abandon a potential feature on a similar computer and instead latch onto the concept of the computer proposed by Roberts. Roberts had a concept of what he wished to produce, but more importantly he had secured an agreement with Intel for the supply of the more powerful 8080 chips at a discount of nearly 80% to the ‘normal’ price of the time. The key was a promise of volume sales, just as it had been for Intel in its deal with Busicom, although that had also involved development funding. Roberts, therefore, had gambled on his ability to produce a machine that could be completed in time to take the lead in the market and to sell in sufficient volume to justify his contract with Intel. There were thus three interested parties in the development: the supplier of the chips (Intel), the builder of the computer (MITS) and the marketer (</span><span class="style1">Popular Electronics</span><span class="style0">). The task of producing the computer, though, rested with Roberts and his team.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The target was to produce a machine that could be sold for under $500. The machine would be built in such a manner that it could be expanded by the user, allowing additional functionality to be added as desired. Development was handicapped by the availability of finance. The budget was extremely tight and funded by debt, with no certainty of future availability. The timescale was determined primarily by the requirements of</span> <span class="style1">Popular Electronics</span><span class="style0">, which had a deadline for the article on the machine to be published. The computer, subsequently named the Altair (reflecting the interest of the editor of</span> <span class="style1">Popular Electronic</span><span class="style0">’s daughter in the television programme</span> <span class="style1">Star Trek</span><span class="style0">), was produced under intense financial and time pressure. The original model was shipped to the magazine and lost en route, causing great consternation for a magazine with a scheduled feature story and no feature. Since another model could not possibly be assembled in time, a mocked-up version had to be used.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The article in the January edition of</span> <span class="style1">Popular Electronics</span> <span class="style0">has been described as the first announcement of the personal computer’s arrival, but what exactly was being announced? Like Roberts’s previous product, the Altair had to be assembled by the purchaser. The Altair had no keyboard, no screen, no printer, and no permanent storage. The key point, however, was that it sold for $397 ($1,100). At this price point it was affordable for the growing number of computer enthusiasts. Enthusiasm was certainly necessary since after hours of assembly there was no guarantee that the product would actually work, and even if it did, the eloquent response it gave to painstaking programming through the flipping of minute switches was to blink some lights. Moreover, the equipment had no means of program storage. This meant that if the excitement of the blinking lights was to be repeated after the power source had been shut down and started up, the switch-flipping had to begin all over again.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Despite the humble nature of the machine it met a hitherto unperceived need, and this was demonstrated by the overwhelming response to the</span> <span class="style1">PE</span> <span class="style0">article. MITS, which to survive required hundreds of orders to amortise the cost of purchased components, found itself with thousands of orders. The company was overwhelmed. Development of add-ons and peripherals had to be set aside as the small staff worked frantically in makeshift premises to avoid falling further behind the increasing flow of orders. Out of necessity, Roberts kept the production cycle as simple as possible, analogous to the famous Henry Ford quote that “the customer can have any color he wants – as long as it is black”. Altair customers could order any combination of requirements, but only the basic components would be shipped. Peripherals or expansion would have to wait until the initial demand was satisfied. The user would receive the basic components, assemble the computer, and then try to figure out what to do with it.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Part of this process involved creating software that would run on the machine, despite the fact that at the time the means to store programs were unavailable to customers. The large computer manufacturers had baulked at the level of resources needed to provide customers with software, peripherals, after-sales service and maintenance. For them this represented simply too large a commitment to a market of unknown size and potential, at a time when maintaining a position in the competitive mini and mainframe markets was demanding enough. If it was demanding for the DECs and IBMs of the world, it was simply overwhelming for MITS.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">One consolation was that the support required could be segmented. The manufacturer had to be able to provide a product that worked and one that could be repaired if necessary. However, a single company did not need to provide all the other items. The level of interest in such a basic product demonstrated the appetite of customers to develop their own knowledge, and investigate what could be done. It was not long before individuals were adapting existing languages and writing software programs for the machine. Since MITS was unable to supply the demand for peripherals and expansion, this left a gap for others to try and fill.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">So far as the software was concerned, two individuals found the Altair intriguing. Paul Allen and Bill Gates had spent much of their spare time working on a machine to collate and analyse traffic flow statistics. In doing this, they had built on their work with the Intel 8008 chip and the development of BASIC, a programming language adapted for the chip. The project and its follow-on work had given them a degree of financial reward, but not enough. The two friends turned to pursue other options, while spending much of their spare time on programming and attempting to turn their Traf-O-Data company into a viable commercial venture. The announcement of the Altair opened up a whole new potential avenue for their efforts.</span> </p>
