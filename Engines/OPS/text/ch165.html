<title>The rise and fall of Netscape - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<h1 id="anchor_4278_0"><span class="style1">The rise and fall of Netscape</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The short history of Netscape began in late 1994 when the Mosaic Communications Corporation changed its name to Netscape Communications Corporation following settlement of a legal dispute with NCSA, which resulted in the latter paying roughly $2.3m for infringement of code and the use of the Mosaic name. By this time, the firm had raised nearly $10m in capital, but was burning cash at a rate of more than $1m per month. Although the company had to tighten its belt for a period, the release of Netscape Navigator and its overwhelming superiority to anything that existed in the market produced startling growth rates. Revenues were haphazard, as the company swayed between the competing goals of rapid market penetration, for which low or zero charging was required, and the need for revenue. Customers could download the software from the Web for a 30-day trial, and were then supposed to pay the $49 licence fee. The browser software had been rushed to market and as a consequence many areas of development were neglected. In a narrow sense, the company was an outstanding success, and clearly the pre-eminent newcomer in America’s newest and fastest growing industry. This was reflected in the success of the initial public offering which took place in August 1995, not much more than a year after its formation. The IPO raised $140m and the success of the shares in the aftermarket created a currency that would have allowed the company to make a share offer for pretty much any other newcomer it desired.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The history that actually unfolded for Netscape was one of strategic and commercial decline almost from the first point of its success. A detailed account of Netscape’s demise is provided by a former competitor, Charles Ferguson of Vermeer <span id="anchor_4282_39"></span>Technologies.<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4884_0">⁹⁹</a> While Ferguson might have had his own axe to grind, his account makes compelling and persuasive reading. It presents a damning indictment of missed opportunity. After a brilliant start, Netscape’s story appears to have been a mixture of immature incompetence and willful arrogance. Business models and historical precedents featured little in the company’s development. Had they done, they would have underlined the need to build a robust architecture and improve software performance, while also pursuing a strategic approach to building alliances and reinforcing the market share that had been gained in the initial flush of success.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">A parallel to the reckless disregard of architecture and strategy can be found in the history of transcontinental railroads, where quality of construction was often sacrificed in the hectic pursuit of land and the completion of urban connections. The railroad companies were to find that those that paid the most attention to quality eventually overtook the others with ease. In the case of the railroads, there was also no equivalent of Microsoft, the brooding presence of an existing monopoly supplier in a closely related business. Netscape’s immaturity was manifested in many ways, not least the haste of its recruitment and the persistent and aggressive verbal challenging of Microsoft’s hegemony.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The short financial history of Netscape illustrates the dangers of attempting to summarise the value of a company by reference to financial figures alone. Netscape enjoyed rapid revenue growth, but negligible and declining earnings. Despite this, the company was acquired by AOL for over $4bn in 2002, a figure some eight times the company’s total revenues. There are only two possible justifications for such a lofty acquisition price. Either Netscape had massive amounts of intellectual capital that could be better exploited by AOL, or else the purchase price was not really $4bn. A wide range of justifications were advanced to justify the merger at the time. These included the value of Netscape’s Netcenter website and the increased number of ‘eyeballs’ this would produce, and the software business which could be used to boost e-commerce activities. Interestingly the browser was only a partial reason given to justify the deal. AOL itself was clear that Microsoft Explorer would be retained.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">From the perspective of fundamental security analysis, it is extremely difficult to see how Netscape could possibly have generated sufficient revenues and profits to justify a price tag of $4bn. Fortunately for AOL, this was not the price it actually paid. Since the acquisition was a paper transaction, the cost to AOL shareholders was dilution of their equity through the issuance of new equity. At the time, there were minimal profits to be diluted, and hence the impact on valuation measures such as the price-earnings ratio was meaningless. The PE was tending to infinity and could only be brought below 100 by looking forward more than three years. For the record, most Wall Street analysts rated AOL as a buy at the time of the Netscape deal and the acquisition was seen as reinforcing this case. For the shareholders of Netscape, the exit price represented an end to the company and an exit which if the AOL shares were monetised would have represented a huge financial gain for a company that in its lifetime had produced an accumulated loss, despite its rapid revenue growth. Some may argue that Netscape was acquired just as it was moving to a break-even point, but it is difficult to sustain the idea that it was poised for further explosive growth, given that it was already losing the browser war to Microsoft at the time.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The early success of Netscape rested largely on an often misused concept in business strategy: the first-mover advantage. Much as early PC users, Internet users were initially limited by the need to have sufficient technical knowledge to give instructions to the system. Just as the PC industry enjoyed a huge broadening of appeal when the concept of a GUI finally made its way from Engelbart to Xerox to Apple and Microsoft, so access to the Internet broadened rapidly when a GUI became available. The Netscape browser was not so much a scientific breakthrough as the outcome of efforts to tailor a tool that was fast and easy to use. The product had technical flaws but was still better than the other available browsers, most of which had not been designed as commercial products. It arrived just at a time when other obstacles to the growth of the Internet were being removed. The history of the computing industry demonstrated clearly that, in order to maintain a leading position, it was necessary for Netscape to establish its product as the industry standard and to make it freely available to all classes of user, including, most importantly, IBM-compatible machines (which by then could have been renamed the Microsoft class).</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Netscape proved not to have learned any lessons from history. Rather than build on its incredible debut by creating an industry standard before its major competitor had time to react, it openly set itself in competition with Microsoft. Rather than seeking to enlist the support of those whose applications would reinforce Netscape’s position, it treated its important potential allies in a peremptory manner. Rather than anticipate Microsoft’s reaction, by continually refining the product and building its defences, Netscape appeared to treat Bill Gates’ company with disdain. This remained its position, even after Microsoft had openly declared its intent to focus on creating its own browser in the (now famous) 1995 internal memo from Bill Gates that appeared a year and a half after Netscape began. Microsoft went on to strangle Netscape, taking advantage of a series of tactical and strategic errors by the company. In 1998, Netscape fell into the waiting arms of a long-time suitor, AOL. This was a failure – but a lucrative one. The exit valuation for Netscape was more than $4bn, if you took the shares offered by AOL at their then value.</span> </p>
