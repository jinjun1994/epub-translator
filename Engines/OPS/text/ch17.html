<h1 id="anchor_615_0"><span class="style1">The new production technology is adapted for transport</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The very success of increased mechanised production that constituted the early part of the Industrial Revolution created with it a series of obstacles that needed to be overcome if the full benefits were to be realised. The new ‘mass’ production required large workforces and out of this need came the rapid expansion of urban centres. It also required the ability to shift goods from point of production to their waiting markets. The canal system had been developed in response to this need but it remained limited in its capability by the relative inflexibility of the system and the method of locomotion: the horse. The logical and obvious step for the Industrial Revolution was to take the technology used in the production of goods and adapt it for use in their transportation.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The markets had to be broadened and deepened by reducing the cost and increasing the speed with which products could be shipped. In this regard the origins of the railway lay in the improvement to the steam engine through the addition of a separate condenser by James Watt in 1769. This invention took steam technology to a new level by dramatically increasing its reliability, efficiency and capacity.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The machines created by Watt and his partner Matthew Boulton were applied in many industries. In the coal industry they were used to pump out wastewater. In factories, they would drive the new machinery of the textile industry. Eventually they began to form the basis for new, improved forms of self-powered transport. In time, these new forms of transport would supplant the dominant position of the canals for freight transport in the UK. More importantly, it would bring the potential to open up whole new continents for economic development, through its ability to reduce the cost and time of transportation.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Reducing the time of transportation had at least one unintended side effect – the development of standard time. In Britain, because of its relatively small size, the difference between time in the east and the west was a matter of minutes rather than hours, but the differences were important nevertheless. For a railway they could be critical, given the difficulties in scheduling operations. Time differences which had previously carried little meaning before began to be significant. In 1845, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway petitioned Parliament to adopt London (i.e. Greenwich) time as the standard for the country. There was much resistance to the change but eventually the benefits led to its wholesale adoption aside from some recalcitrant outposts. (In North Wales, for example, one local railway company kept its clocks precisely 16½ minutes different from Greenwich time.)</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">James Watt, together with his chief engineer William Murdoch, was primarily interested in producing stationary steam engines. It was only as a sideline that they experimented with constructing a steam locomotive. A Cornishman by the name of Richard Trevithick broke new ground in transportation and on Christmas Eve 1801 completed the first successful preliminary test of a steam locomotive.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It is not often recounted that three days later the locomotive went out of control and needed to be stored. Nor is it normally recalled that its operators repaired to a local hostelry for food (and ale), leaving the locomotive unattended. The result? The boiler exploded, taking with it the surrounding buildings.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In fact, Watt had looked at the prospects for developing a high-pressure steam engine but had not pursued them due to concerns over safety. Nevertheless, Trevithick was undeterred by this setback and filed for a patent as he sought to develop a more compact powerful engine. More mishaps followed. In 1803 one of his high-pressure boilers again exploded, this time killing three people. The engine in question had been pumping water out of a corn mill and the boiler had been left unattended when the operator slipped away to fish for eels in a local pond. Even though the explosion was due to operator neglect, this did not inhibit rivals Boulton and Watt from using the tragedy to undermine the reputation of the high-pressure engines. Trevithick reacted by installing a number of safety features allowing steam to be released whenever the boiler pressure exceeded safe levels. In the early years, high-pressure boilers were typically used for a wide variety of tasks – pumping water, crushing rock, boring cannon, powering mills.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">All, it seemed, except transportation. It was only later that the transport potential of a small powerful engine was recognised. One of the landmark developments was marked with a wager. Trevithick bet a neighbouring ironmaster 500 guineas ($50,000) that he could haul ten tons of iron ten miles on a tramway. In February 1804 he won the bet – with the first locomotive to run on tracks. The better-known steam engines such as Stephenson’s</span> <span class="style1">Rocket</span> <span class="style0">(which were later to become historical landmarks in the history of the locomotive industry) were derivatives of the basic principles embodied in Trevithick’s early work.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It is difficult to overstate the importance of the steam engine. It led to massive increases in productive potential in Europe’s largely agrarian economies. Factories were expanded and the development of towns and urban areas followed. Steam engines allowed the movement of such large bulky products as iron and coal to markets at competitive prices.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">They were also critical, particularly in North America, in opening up new land for development. In Europe – and particularly the UK – the new railways essentially linked up existing urban centres. This meant their funding and viability could be estimated with a fair degree of assurance. For the emerging market of the USA, the position was entirely different. The railways were as much a tool of fostering development as they were a linkage between existing communities or industries. That difference is significant – because (at least in part) it explains the emergence in the US of the so-called ‘robber barons’.</span> </p>
