<title>Web 2.0 (2008+): a new bubble? - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<h1 id="anchor_4761_0"><span class="style1">Web 2.0 (2008+): a new bubble?</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The early years of the Internet – what is often now called Web 1.0 – was brought to a close by the bursting of the great stock market bubble. This bubble was a commentary on the exuberant behaviour of investors as much as on the potency of the industrial and social changes which the explosion in Internet use and availability had created. That potency has not diminished and indeed raises the question of whether the economic and stock market impact of the technology is once again creating inflated expectations among investors.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Stock market bubbles tend to ‘burst’ rather than gradually deflate and the TMT bubble was no exception. The fallout from the bursting of the bubble in 2000 was certainly severe, with leading market indices falling by 50% or more between 2000 and 2003. From being awash with liquidity, the appetite for risk in financial markets dissolved almost overnight. Companies that had locked in capital reserves were suddenly in a position where this became a competitive advantage, rather than a hindrance.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Risk replaced reward as the driving dynamic. This was true of both the financial community and the financial press. For the financial community, the IPO market remained dormant for an extended period. Less capital was available and more proof of operating success and profitability was required before a stock market listing became feasible. The primary funding route for new businesses reverted to being private individuals and private equity. As competitors disappeared, private equity firms which had capital to invest suddenly entered a golden period of investment opportunities. In the media, the downturn produced a flood of inquests into how investors allowed themselves to be so foolish. Most Internet publications went to the wall. Hundreds of people who at one stage had been paper millionaires on the basis of shareholdings in fashionable Internet stocks discovered that they were nothing of the <span id="anchor_4767_141"></span>sort.<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4894_0">¹⁰⁹</a> The Federal Reserve and other leading central banks slashed interest rates in an effort to stave off a damaging recession – a move that was to have unhappy consequences just a few years later.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Eventually the pessimism induced by the stock market crash faded and companies with successful business models began to show results. Early attempts to monetise search and social media through licensing payments foundered because users were mostly unwilling to pay meaningful amounts for the service. However, the richness of the personal data that use of the services provided proved in time to be a goldmine and accelerated the trend in advertising revenue from offline to online, producing fabulous revenue growth for Google and Facebook. The obvious flip side was the melting away of advertising revenues for traditional print media. In retail, meanwhile, few companies can now survive without an online distribution capability and the pricing discipline which that entails. Those that manage it well have found good support from newly enthused investors. Having a good online strategy is widely seen as a positive differentiator. Although it took a decade or so to do so, the technology sector of the stock market has once again delivered strong and positive growth for nearly five years.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The valuation of Internet stocks bears little resemblance to the excesses of the bubble period and remains in a reasonably narrow band. When comparing the movement in market prices for technology stocks in 2000 and the time of writing, the conclusions are significantly different. Although the US Internet index has now exceeded the peak levels of the 2000 bubble, it has done so on the back of rising revenues and profits, rather than promises and blue-sky numbers. The valuations, measured by price-earning ratios or price to book, may or may not prove to be full, but they are no more extended that the US market as a whole. This is very different from the bubble environment when valuations were extreme and could not be justified in any circumstances. Euphoria dissipates quickly but scepticism born of the pain that follows can last a considerable time. If the Internet bubble was a warning to investors not to get carried away, the experience of the financial and mining sectors – both of which subsequently experienced their own bubbles – is evidence that those lessons are rarely heeded for long. In the technology sector, however, public markets have fortunately been less willing to suspend disbelief than before.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Partly because of the success of Google and Facebook, and partly because the IPO market is less active than before, the main difference today is that companies have remained in private ownership much longer than previously. As a consequence valuations are increasingly determined not by public markets but by a fairly narrow group of investors operating in the pre-IPO market. In early 2016 the combined market capitalisation of 170+ of these so-called ‘unicorns’ (private technology companies with a valuation greater than $1bn) exceeded half a trillion <span id="anchor_4773_87"></span>dollars.<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4895_0">¹¹⁰</a> Whether or not that aggregate valuation eventually gets validated is open to question, but it does not automatically mean that the outcome has to be a repeat of the earlier technology bubble.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It is true that the private-equity funding of Google and Facebook has encouraged many others to try and replicate those successes. If history is a guide, the mortality rate among the 170+ unicorns will be high and the probability of picking winners low, even if the embedded technology actually succeeds (always a demanding assumption). It is interesting that a number of successful professional fund managers whose normal area of operation is listed equities have recently been trying to buy into the returns that appear to be accruing in private equity. The difficulty they face is that unlisted investments are subject to different valuation factors and ultimately require either a public listing or an acquisition by rivals so that the private equity holders can exit. Will the $0.5trn of value accorded in aggregate to the unicorns all be realised? On past history it looks a tall order. History also suggests that, if it is eventually realised, it will accrue to a relatively small number of investments – with the vast majority of the remainder falling by the wayside.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">That is not the same as concluding, however, that the private firms represent a new technology bubble in waiting. Firstly, the quantum of funds which has flowed into US technology is a fraction of what happened during the tech bubble of 1999–2000. Secondly, the largest part of this funding has been devoted to a relatively small number of private companies, such as Uber. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the majority of the returns obtained in technology stocks continues to accrue before they go public. While the venture capital community keenly extols the virtues of its style of investing, an equally valid interpretation is that, given the attractive returns already made by private investors, there may be little or no headroom to create attractive IPOs for public equity investors. A more likely route is that private equity firms will try to encourage hitherto listed equity investors to participate ahead of any IPO, both to validate the price and partially cash in. New investors will then see a nominal profit on IPO, but support the share issuance as their other funds participate, thus allowing a later exit for the original investors as the price is potentially supported. The question then is whether by this stage any potential for capital appreciation remains?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">What this points to is an unsurprising conclusion. Just as in the TMT bubble, we have had a period of low interest rates and this has expanded valuations across all types of asset. On this occasion private investors have been slower to seek public listings, preferring to raise valuations with successive funding rounds. That suggests that it will become significantly harder for investors in public markets to make money when they do eventually list. One of the characteristics of a bubble is that it tends to be undiscerning; sometimes the name of a company alone is sufficient, if it is a fashionable segment of the market, to command a premium valuation. The list of companies in the unicorn stable is more diverse than that. Many of the unicorns may never justify their current valuation. On the other hand, some may well earn – and deserve – their higher valuations. This outcome would be entirely consistent with history.</span> </p>
