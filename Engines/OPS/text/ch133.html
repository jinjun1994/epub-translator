<p><span class="style0">The issue that continually faced users was one of cost. A mainframe was expensive to purchase and maintain. To make it efficient required multiple users. To extend the number of users required the ability to share the use of the machine: in other words, to timeshare. Initially timesharing took the form of batch processing of computer jobs. Users would type their programs on cards and submit them to a processing centre. The processing centre would then aggregate and allocate all the jobs to try and ensure efficient usage of the machine. This was efficient for the machine, but not for the user, who would only find out his programming success after an extended delay. What was required was a system that allowed multiple users the ability to work on the computer simultaneously without interfering with each other’s progress.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The logic behind the development of timesharing was founded on the view of economies of scale in computing, summarised at the time by Grosch’s Law which stated that the ‘power of the computer varied with the square of its price’. Even if the relationship was not a scientifically proven one, it reflected the position that an extra dollar spent brought more than an incremental dollar of computing power. If this was the case then logic suggested an operating model similar to that used in power generation, where a centralised generator distributed power to end users. Out of this was born the computer utility framework. The commercial focus of the time was therefore on ‘utility computing’ and this was reflected in the financial markets. The potential market such computing networks might achieve was almost exactly the same as that later claimed for the Internet. Although the technology was ultimately misspecified, the spectre of timeshare computing makes fascinating reading many years on.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The grand vision of universal access to computing and global information systems proved irresistible for financial markets, the appetite of which had already been whetted by genuine growth in the technology sector. A technological commodity available to all certainly looked potentially lucrative. Since economic conditions were also buoyant, capital was available to fund such ventures. Almost any company perceived as being a beneficiary of the move to timesharing found its share price soaring. One such company was the computing timeshare company, University Computing Company (UCC), based in Dallas, Texas. Such was the excitement that its share price rose from $1.50 to over $155 before crashing back to earth. The problem for UCC and the other timeshare companies was that the cost of the complex software needed to make centralised computing a reality, together with the falling costs of processing power, fatally undermined the initial commercial premise of the business. When the concept so heavily anticipated by financial markets was shown to be a dud, retribution was equally abrupt and brutal.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The US military had the same vision as the commercial sector about timeshare computing. There were, however, complications. Primary among these was the threat posed to central communications by nuclear attack. A timeshare-based system which tied together geographically disparate facilities and which could continue functioning with part of the system disabled was preferable to a system with a nerve centre that could be neutralised by a single attack. There therefore seemed to be both commercial and military reasons for developing a sophisticated communication and timeshare network. The reason it took 20 to 30 years for the vision to be fully realised was that the commercial premise behind the timeshare concept was flawed. Grosch’s law – that computer performance increases as the square of the cost – proved to have a short lifespan, given that, almost as it was being promulgated, technology was already advancing to allow the emergence first of the minicomputer and then the personal computer.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Nevertheless, at the time the mainframe dominated, and centralised processing remained paramount. The concern over potential vulnerability to nuclear attack was fuelled by the Cold War and the apparent lead held by the USSR in rocket and space technology. It provided the impetus for the creation of an agency charged with the task of furthering military and defence-related research. The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was established in 1958, spurred by the shock of the Sputnik launch, and within three years had moved its space operations to NASA to concentrate primarily on defence. From that point forward ARPA funding would play a vital role in directing the cutting edge of technology. With timesharing, the main goal was to create a single network. Seven years after its creation, ARPA began funding research to overcome the problems associated with the lack of interaction between different timeshare networks.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">By the mid-1960s work had begun to link different networks, work which was to produce the ARPANET, out of which would later evolve the Internet. In computing, though, it remained a mainframe-dominated world, a world which was to be rudely upset, however, by the continued advance of technology. This advance had been occurring concurrently with the development of the mainframe, but the true commercial significance would take some years to emerge.</span> </p>
