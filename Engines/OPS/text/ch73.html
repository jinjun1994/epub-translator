<p><span class="style0">The end of the Civil War provided a fresh impetus for the oil industry as large numbers of men sought their fortune in the oilfields. Speculative fever gripped the industry, attracting massive inflows of capital. Hundreds of new companies were formed to exploit the anticipated opportunities in the exciting new business. The market for lighting was obvious, the chemistry and technology were known; all that was required was to find, refine and transport the product. Speculation was not limited to company formation; capital very quickly filtered down to the sale and purchase of leases, the prices of which soared on prospects of future production. In the early years, the existing legal framework helped to promote boom-and-bust conditions. The reason was that the ‘law of capture’ prevailed in drilling, meaning that drillers accessing a common pool of oil were motivated to drain as much oil as possible to prevent their neighbours removing it first. This led to a style of drilling which ignored damage to oil reservoirs and frequently led to premature exhaustion of the fields. The activity was frantic, causing unstable levels of production and hence unstable prices. The lengths drillers would go to in order to extract oil were epitomised by the increasing use of gunpowder, and later nitroglycerine, to increase and accelerate oil removal.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Eventually the frenetic activity led to a crash and in 1866 oil prices fell to a low of $2.40 a barrel. Producers in Oil Creek reacted in time-honoured fashion to the damaging price decline caused by overproduction, and sought to reduce output. The mechanism for achieving this was a cartel arrangement which allocated production limits among members, thus providing greater stability and rising prices. Unfortunately for the producers, the law of capture and the relatively low barriers to entry created a market structure so fragmented that cooperation in production could never be sustained. The Oil Creek Association, created during the Civil War, made little headway. The same happened with the Petroleum Producers’ Association formed in 1869. Without a single entity able to dictate terms and enforce quotas and pricing, the industry was destined to be unstable. Ironically, though, the inability of the producers to create stability allowed the emergence of a new influence that, as the Standard Oil Trust, would eventually dominate the industry.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The unstable nature of the oil industry provided the environment in which one company was able gradually to take control of the industry. In 1859 John D. Rockefeller entered into a partnership with Maurice Clark in Cleveland, Ohio. Rockefeller and Clark traded products ranging from pork to salt. With the opening of a rail link to Cleveland they also started to trade rock oil from Pennsylvania. The partnership expanded into Pennsylvania oil at the prompting of Sam Andrews, a self-taught chemist employed in a Cleveland lard-refining factory. The factory had received a consignment of oil and Andrews immediately realised the significance for the production of kerosene. The partnership placed Rockefeller in charge of refining, a business which was effectively started as a sideline with a $4,000 investment ($0.5m). Rockefeller built the refinery on a piece of land on the banks of a waterway which flowed into the Cuyahoga River, and adjacent to the railway track being constructed. Business prospered with the demand created by the Civil War and the expansion of the country westwards. However, the business remained extremely volatile. Oil was transported by barrel in wagon trains over rough terrain before being carried to the refineries. Each barrel held 42 gallons, and this remains the standard measurement to this day. Faced with the volatile prices of crude oil, Rockefeller quickly determined to concentrate on the marginally less volatile refining business.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">By 1865 the partners owned one of Cleveland’s most successful refineries. However, a disagreement over the appropriate pace of expansion caused the partnership to dissolve and the partners agreed to bid against each other to take over the existing business. Rockefeller outbid Clark, buying the business for $72,500 ($6.5m). This transaction laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of Standard Oil. Within 12 months of acquiring sole control of his first refinery, Rockefeller had constructed his second, and his accumulated sales exceeded $2m ($165m). However, the business, while highly profitable, showed few signs of stability, the supply of crude oil being simply too unstable.</span> </p>
