<p><span class="style0">Although Marconi basked in the adoration of the American press and skillfully responded to their requests, his fame was of a populist nature. He was not universally respected by the academic scientific community. Like Edison, he attracted criticism rather than acclaim from his classically schooled university counterparts. Marconi’s critics had a substantial list of areas to attack. The first wave of criticism focused on whether he had actually achieved anything by himself, pointing out that ‘all’ he had done was assemble known instruments. The second wave was somewhat contradictory, suggesting that Marconi’s invention was rudimentary and impractical. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the negative criticism owed much to academic pique that a non-theoretical scientist should presume to encroach on an area in which he was substantially less qualified than they.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">In 1899, a lot remained to be done to turn radio into a commercial activity. Marconi’s radio could not transmit reliably over any distance greater than 35 miles. The radio sent all its messages on the same frequency, so only one radio could operate within a given radius at any particular time if interference was to be avoided. The waves produced by the radio could be picked up by anyone with a receiver. Given that a large part of the potential client base was military and naval, this was a serious problem. The equipment itself could only operate at a slow speed and was prone to interference from outside influences. The telegraph could transmit Morse code 20 times faster. Finally, there was a common consensus in the scientific community that transmission range was ultimately limited by the size of aerial that could be constructed. As a consequence, transatlantic communication was deemed to be impractical.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Chief among the critics of Marconi’s work were his peers in the scientific community. In late 1899, Professor Reginald Fessenden presented a paper to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Fessenden noted how he had turned down an invitation to cover the yacht races by the</span> <span class="style1">New York Herald</span><span class="style0">, which had then turned to Marconi instead. Fessenden had first developed an interest in Hertzian waves when he was working as an assistant to Thomas Edison, and continued this interest in his academic posts. He outlined the shortcomings of the apparatus that had been constructed by Marconi and the method by which the trials had been implemented. The method of creating the electromagnetic wave was poor, he said, as unwanted signals would be created and diminish the strength of the main signal. So far as receiving was concerned, there was no known way of tuning the receiver to the correct frequency and so eliminate irrelevant signals. Finally, Fessenden alleged that Marconi had conducted his research in a haphazard manner and made little or no measurements and records of his work to which reference could be made. Anyone attempting to construct a working, practical model of wireless telegraphy would be stumbling in the dark without a frame of reference.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Whatever his motivation, the majority of Fessenden’s points proved to be entirely accurate. Whether Marconi was concerned or not is another issue. Most likely his view followed that of Edison in similar circumstances. Marconi’s aim was to produce a commercially viable method of doing what the telegraph did without the need for cables. This would allow its deployment in places where fixed links were impossible. His approach was to use trial and error on the technology of the time and, where problems arose, to solve them in a practical rather than a theoretical way. He was open-minded about the value of academic contributions. His only concern was whether these could be harnessed in a commercial environment.</span> </p>
