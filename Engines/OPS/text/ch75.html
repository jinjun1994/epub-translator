<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Despite the fact that the market for kerosene was growing rapidly, it could not keep pace with the expansion of supply. Crude oil was in overproduction and it was estimated that refining capacity was three times the market’s <span id="anchor_1957_39"></span>requirements.<a href="ch80.html#anchor_2161_0">⁴⁴</a> As a consequence, the price of kerosene halved. The relatively low cost of entry and the lure of high profits and a quick return on investment produced a fragmented and oversupplied business. In 1870 Rockefeller estimated that 90% of refineries were making losses. Despite his initial deals with the railroads, Rockefeller was still faced with an industry structure that militated against stability. His solution was identical to that unsuccessfully adopted by the drillers: to restrict supply and raise prices. But in order for Rockefeller to be successful where the drillers had failed, he had to gain a semblance of control over the industry. He needed to get into a position from which prices and output could be dictated. Despite the fact that Rockefeller controlled 10% of US refining capacity, he needed a much larger market share to control the market. Rockefeller’s first step was to ensure he had access to sufficient capital to enable him to expand his domain. In January 1870 the Standard Oil Company (Ohio) was formed, with $1m ($75m) in capital. It was testament to Rockefeller’s reputation that he was able to raise this capital, given that the financial environment was one of panic following an attempt by Jay Gould and Jim Fisk to corner the gold market. Rockefeller’s timing was also fortuitous, in that it preceded the stock market collapse of 1873 and the economic hardship in the years that followed. The market for kerosene continued to deteriorate and prices dropped a further 25%, causing some competitors to declare bankruptcy. Standard Oil, however, managed to remain profitable and declare dividends while at the same time expanding and strengthening its position through discreet purchases of refineries and related businesses. In January 1872, Standard Oil raised a further $2.5m (almost $200m) for its war chest. This was the bankroll for a campaign which one could view as either scandal or success; a campaign that established Standard Oil as the dominant force in the industry. Again the railroads were of central importance and it is significant that one of the investors in Standard Oil was none other than Commodore Vanderbilt.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The key actor in the saga that was to unfold was Tom Scott, the autocratic head of the Pennsylvania Railroad. In November 1871, Scott proposed the foundation of the Southern Improvement Company (SIC). Scott proposed that the refiners who joined the SIC would receive preferential freight rates. They would also receive a ‘drawback’, part of the freight payment paid by non-members. For example, Standard Oil would receive a rebate of 40 cents for every barrel of crude it shipped to Cleveland, and a further 40 cents for every barrel its competitors shipped. In other words, one group of refiners would pay higher transportation costs to subsidise another. Rockefeller was to control almost half the shares of the SIC, with the balance being held by refiners in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For the railroads the advantage lay in Rockefeller acting as an ‘independent’ allocator of freight. Standard Oil was to ensure that the competing railroads of Vanderbilt, Gould and others received a predetermined allocation of oil freight. This was intended to address the age-old problem of cartels, namely how to enforce the agreed allocations of supply. Rockefeller would effectively act as the ‘honest broker’ who would make a railway cartel work. The economic benefit for Standard Oil was clear, in that the competitive advantage created for members would eventually put non-members out of business. In the event, the SIC was never to operate because as word of it seeped out, a huge public reaction unfolded, beginning in the oilfields of Pennsylvania, extending to the excluded refiners of New York and finally spreading to the Pennsylvanian legislature and the US Congress. In March 1872, the railroads bowed to public pressure by annulling the SIC contracts and agreeing to standard rates.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">While the annulment was undoubtedly a blow to Rockefeller, it was softened by the results of his activity between the time he was first contacted by Scott and the eventual abandonment of the agreement. After raising additional capital in January 1872, and with the rumours of the SIC swirling round the refining industry, Rockefeller purchased all but four of his 26 competitors in Cleveland. In an environment of weak pricing, and with rumours of their SIC-assisted fate (fuelled by the Standard Oil camp), resistance to Rockefeller’s overtures was not sustained for long. In the context of the oil business these transactions were critical, because in an incredibly short space of time a giant had been created. Very quickly, Standard Oil’s attention shifted to widening its influence over the industry.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Standard Oil was unhappy that the transportation system operated with a single tariff structure for all shippers. Being in Cleveland placed it at a competitive disadvantage to refiners whose sites were adjacent to the producing fields. The Cleveland refiners had to pay 50 cents a barrel to ship crude oil to the refineries, plus the cost of shipping it onwards to New York and the waiting markets. Pittsburgh refiners suffered a similar cost disadvantage. The local refiners’ costs were much lower. Rockefeller’s first attempt at removing the cost disadvantage took the form of openly trying to create a refiners’ cartel. Teaming up with the principal Pittsburgh refiners, Rockefeller and Flagler travelled to Titusville to try and sign up local refiners and negotiate with the producers’ cartel, the Petroleum Producers’ Association. To satisfy the producers, the plan they agreed provided for payments of $5 a barrel of crude oil, twice the prevailing rate, if supply was restricted to specified levels. The two cartels, however, soon went the same way as their predecessors. On the producer side, attempts at enforcement were crude, often brutal, and ultimately ineffective. The incentive to pump oil and take a ‘free ride’ on the cartel’s restricted production and higher prices was too great to be ignored. The so-called ‘Treaty of Titusville’, signed in New York in December 1872, survived only until January 1873. This was to be Rockefeller’s last attempt at ‘voluntary’ restraint.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For his next step, which was to gain control of the oil industry, Rockefeller had to surmount two hurdles. He had to achieve control of both production and transportation of refined product, and he had to do this within a legal framework which ostensibly prevented the ownership of companies by out-of-state parents.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">On his side was the fact that the economic environment was deteriorating. The excesses of the railroads, and the associated stock market bubble and subsequent financial distress, contributed to the economic turmoil which followed the failure of the Northern Pacific Railroad and the collapse of the formerly distinguished banking house of Jay Cooke &amp; Company. This took place in September 1873 and was an early indicator of financial troubles, including widespread insolvency, defaults on railroad bonds, liquidation of banks and the temporary closure of the stock exchange. Over the next six years the US economy fell into a slump, with huge unemployment and wage deflation of almost 25%.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In times of economic hardship, cash is king; in times of depression, cash is god. Those who had cash or access to it were in an immensely strong position. In the refining industry, with the crude oil price down to 48 cents a barrel (below the cost of water in some areas), Rockefeller’s access to cash made him unstoppable. Now he could approach the struggling refiners with a deal attractive in its own right, and ultimately irresistible. The alternative to joining forces with Standard Oil was to face the consequences of being on the wrong side of the company – which could easily translate into practical difficulties, such as sudden lack of access to barrels or railway tank cars. In late 1874, the principal refiners in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia quietly acquiesced and joined Standard Oil. As the momentum of Rockefeller’s acquisitions grew, resistance crumbled and he gained control of the entire refining industry, including his previous opponents in Titusville.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The final piece of the jigsaw was completed in 1875 with the purchase of the West Virginia refiner J. N. Camden &amp; Company. The significance of this particular acquisition lay in its relationship with the Baltimore and Ohio, a railroad that had attempted to sustain Standard Oil’s competitors. Like many of Standard Oil’s acquisitions, the purchase remained secret, meaning the company was able to negotiate a ‘drawdown’ agreement that mandated a payment to them for any oil shipped on the B&amp;O line. This meant Standard Oil was effectively receiving a payment from the railroad specifically designed to sustain its competitors.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The remaining competitors in the region were also swept into the fold. Now, as well as control over a large part of the refining business, Rockefeller also had control over a large part of the freight traffic on the railroads, meaning he was in a position to dictate rather than negotiate terms. This allowed him to achieve his long-cherished ambition of removing the natural advantage of proximity that the Titusville refiners enjoyed, which he did by subsidising the shipment of crude oil to his refiners.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Although Rockefeller continued to rely on the railroads as the principal means of transportation through much of the 1870s, their limitations and inevitable replacement by pipelines was evident even then. Standard Oil knew that control of distribution, allied with control of refining, was a vital element in its dominance. Rockefeller moved swiftly to take control or a significant stake in any pipelines that might threaten his hegemony.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Unless it maintained control of distribution, new refiners could easily spring up to bring a return of competition and fluctuating prices. Standard Oil used any and all weapons to ensure continued control. It built pipelines where necessary, bought them where appropriate and suppressed them where necessary. The largest threat came from the pipeline built by the independent producers under the Tidewater Pipe Line Company banner. Begun in 1878, this pipeline survived Standard Oil’s challenges and obstructions through the legal system. The pipeline was a technical challenge being over 100 miles long, three times longer than had been successfully completed to date, and running over mountains of more than 2,500 feet. On the eve of its completion, Rockefeller unsuccessfully attempted to buy a stake. In May 1879, the first crude oil was pumped through the pipeline. However, in 1882, when the original investor group fell out over increased funding, Standard Oil was able to take a stake and, eventually, control.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Rockefeller had thus maintained effective control over the world market for illumination. Was this strategy profitable? In the late 1870s it is estimated that Rockefeller’s stake in Standard Oil was worth $18m ($1.5bn). This was not yet a fortune the size of America’s richest scion Vanderbilt, whose estate was valued at $100m (over $8bn today), but nevertheless it was an astounding figure to have accumulated in such a short space of time.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The overwhelming influence of Standard Oil was to last for a long time. It remained the dominant player in the global market. In the early 1880s, more than 85% of the world’s crude oil production was in Pennsylvania and over 70% of that production was exported outside the US. Standard Oil kerosene was to be found in the developed economies of Europe and as far east as China and Japan. Standard Oil dominated these markets, as it did the domestic US <span id="anchor_1983_82"></span>market.<a href="ch80.html#anchor_2162_0">⁴⁵</a> Its grip on the US market was tightened by increasing its control over the supply chain, taking control of marketing and banning its retailers from supplying competitor products. The Standard Oil Trust was formed as a holding company, which controlled the operating entities throughout the country, but allowed Rockefeller to remain one step removed from their day-to-day operations.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the early 1880s, the only threats to Standard Oil came from potential competitors in kerosene and other sources of lighting. In the case of the latter Rockefeller was covered; he recognised that gas lighting was important for the lighting market and had taken control of a large part of the gas industry. The threat from Edison’s incandescent lamp remained embryonic, it was not to materialise until almost ten years later. In the case of the threat from other kerosene refiners, Rockefeller’s effective control of the railroad industry and pipelines in Pennsylvania ensured his domination. So long as Pennsylvania remained the dominant source of crude oil, Standard Oil was impregnable, and the dominance of Pennsylvania was to last almost a quarter of a century.</span> </p>
