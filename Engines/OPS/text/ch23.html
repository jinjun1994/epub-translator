<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There were several years of strong share price growth when the railways were supplanting canals. The bubble of the 1840s deflated under the weight of overheated expectations and changing economic conditions. In the 50 years that followed, investments in railways were not rewarding ones in either an absolute or a relative sense. There were occasional pockets of excitement which would cause railway shares to trade once more at levels that could not be justified in terms of underlying profitability. These pockets though were short-lived and set against a backdrop of a long-term declining trend. But the economics of the railway business remained solid. It was not until the advent of the automobile at the end of the century that the competitiveness of the railways was itself undermined.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Given that dividends were paid for most of this period, anyone who invested at the peak might perhaps have earned back his investment by the end of the century. In aggregate, over a very long period of time, there is no question that, for all their economic impact, the railways provided negative returns, whether you measure that in real, relative or absolute terms. This illustrates the general truth that in the aftermath to any period of speculative excess, when companies are funded on the expectation of instantaneous stock market returns, huge amounts of capital are wasted on non-economic projects. Many companies end in liquidation after such a phase. Although the promoters usually emerge with positive returns, and the technology itself succeeds in delivering the results that were forecast, the average investor frequently struggles to emerge with significant returns.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In many cases, as with the railways, valuations at the peak of bubbles become so detached from reality that investors are in effect discounting the whole of tomorrow. Given that new technologies are prone to continuous change, and face in most cases the inevitability of intense business competition, identifying in advance the companies with the best prospects is difficult. It is certainly not as easy as identifying the losers. At a relatively early stage, it was evident that canals had lost their economic viability. They could not shift either their position on the cost curve or the curve itself sufficiently to counter the railways. The investment decision to exit an industry in secular decline in favour of other opportunities should have been relatively straightforward.</span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">York and North Midland Railway</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Should investors have seen through Hudson?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Virtually the entire asset base of Hudson’s railway company, the York and North Midland Railway, was funded out of shareholders’ capital, with almost no funding from retained profits. This looks unusual to modern eyes, but was less so in the context of the time. All promoters of new technologies know that raising capital depends heavily on creating a perception of success. In the case of the railways, this perception of success depended on the level of dividend payout being sustained. Any sign of weakening in dividends would have been taken as tantamount to an admission that operating profits were lower than investors had been led to believe. As the building of a railway network was a capital-intensive business, there would be legitimate questions even today about the correct level of depreciation to be charged.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">At the time depreciation played no role in the financial reporting of companies. Financial reporting was a requirement of the listing particulars of the company and the parliamentary act that established it, but not a prescriptive legal requirement. In addition, there was no requirement for independent auditing. As a consequence, financial reporting was at the whim of the company. The distinction between capital and income was one which could be (and was) arbitrarily determined by the company itself. There was little barrier to dividends being paid out of capital masquerading as profits, so long as the balance sheet could sustain it.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">For the outside investor, verifying the company’s financial results would have been impossible. Publicly available information was also relatively sparse. Nevertheless, there were sufficient warning signs to cause even a contemporary investor some concern. For example, the company claimed that its dividend, equivalent to over 10% of profits, was well covered by income. But the company accounts (reconstructed in the accompanying charts) showed an equity base that was growing alongside a return on assets of less than 5%, a combination that was only sustainable in the short run. Funding the expansion of the railway through new equity was also surprising, in the sense that equity capital was more expensive than debt.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">1.9 – Hudson’s railway company: the York and North Midland</span> </p>
<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style1">Railway Chronicle. Railway Times.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Expansion should have been funded through retained profits, supplemented by debt, which in the early part of the period was available at a much lower cost than 10%. For the investor, the decision to fund growth entirely through issues of new equity would have demanded an explanation. Another anomaly which required explanation was the reported level of profit. The margins seemed to be very high, something that you would normally associate with monopoly pricing or a level of operating costs which was kept low through efficiency or capital underspend. That monopoly conditions were absent should have clearly pointed investors towards the questions of the cost and maintenance of the fixed asset base.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">If the way in which Hudson massaged his profits to preserve his dividend capacity is clear enough now, even at the time the inconsistencies in the company’s financial statements and funding requirements should have created doubt in investors’ minds. This doubt would have been that net income was being overstated through artificially deflated expenses. At that point, the logical next question would have been to ask why such artifice was used. The obvious answer was that it was needed to sustain the dividend payout, on which in turn the capital to fund expansion depended. A modern parallel might be with the boom in conglomerates during the 1970s and 1980s. These companies were built on the back of continual acquisitions, which maintained growth in an accounting sense but rarely added much in the way of economic value.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">So long as they could buy companies at an apparent lower valuation, in the short run their earnings continued to appear to grow (so much the better if they could also be run as cash cows). Unless the acquirer was able to make serious improvements to the business as well, the whole process was little more than a house of cards. For the York and North Midland Railway, the process was somewhat similar, though more short-lived because the favoured investment criterion of the day was dividend yield rather than price earnings multiple. The company faced a constant outflow of cash to pay dividends to shareholders. It needed a counterbalancing inflow from share issuance.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The game of equity funding the dividends continued for nearly ten years, during which the company expanded through acquisition, until the company could no longer make the arithmetic work any more. As the shareholder base grew, so did the dividend requirements. When profitability started to fall, the game could not continue. When interest rates rose and the economy slowed, the whole edifice came crashing to the ground. The case of the York and North Midland Railway underlines the need for a timeless analytical discipline: when in doubt, check the cash flow position. Profit can be misrepresented, but other than in cases of deliberate fraud, analysing cash balances and cash flows typically provides a better picture of the true underlying position.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The extent to which the railway mania had permeated society and the financial impact this had subsequently became the subject of a number of contemporary accounts, something which was to become a feature of future equity market bubbles (see figure 1.10).</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“The extraordinary mania had seized on merchant and manufacturer with a power which defied control. It was condemned by parliament, and two-thirds of the members were dealers. It was condemned by the press, and editors were provisional committee men. It was condemned in the pulpit; and while a bishop was obliged to reprove his clergy, an archbishop was said to hold council with Mr. Hudson. The lord who derided it in the park, was beheld the next day in Throgmorton-street. The lady who ridiculed it in her boudoir, was seen the next hour at her broker’s.”</span> <span class="style1">(p.158)</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“The subtle poison of avarice diffused itself through every class. It infected alike the courtly and exclusive occupant of the halls of the great and the homely inmate of the humble cottage. Duchesses were even known to soil their fingers with scrip, and old maids to inquire with trembling eagerness the price of stocks. Young ladies deserted the marriage list and the obituary for the share list, and startled their lovers with questions respecting the operations of bulls and bears.”</span> <span class="style1">(p.174)</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“On Thursday, 16th October, 1845, the Bank of England raised the rate of interest; and the effect was immediate. On that day men looked darkly and doubtfully at each other; on Friday there was a considerable cessation of bargains, and on Saturday the alarm commenced. The news passed from the capital to every province in the empire, that there was a panic in the share market. From London to Liverpool and from Liverpool to Edinburgh the intelligence spread. Money was scarce; the price of stock and scrip lowered; the confidence of the people was broken, and the vision of a dark future on every face. Advertisements were suddenly withdrawn from the papers.”</span> <span class="style1">(p.191)</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“Such were the effects of the last great money mania and its attendant panic. Many a futile effort to re-instate confidence was made by some, and many a bold attempt to regain the money they had lost was made by others. An undue depression was the natural result of the extreme excitement, and shares in lines which were not worse than they ever were, fell in price.”</span> <span class="style1">(p.253)</span> </p>
