<h1 id="anchor_5087_0"><span class="style1">Where we are today</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The process of rationalisation and refinancing that has historically been the central feature of stage 4 in the technology cycle has been ongoing for well over a decade, while the Internet age has moved into its final consolidation phase. We can see those companies that have emerged as long-term winners, including second-generation adapters of the new technology, and the many more who have either faltered, been taken over or simply failed. Companies such as Apple and Amazon have survived and profited hugely from the second order effects of the disruptive new technology, enabling them to achieve – at least for now – dominant global market positions in their specialist areas of smartphones and online retailing. They have been joined by Google and Facebook, which have given away services to harvest vital consumer information that can be monetised by helping advertisers and retailers better target their customers.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As in previous historical periods, many investors lost large amounts of money either by trying and failing to pick the winners or by holding on to their former high-flying stocks once the peak in valuations had passed. It took roughly ten years for share prices in the telecoms, media and technology sectors even to start recovering from the dramatic declines that followed the bursting of the bubble in 2000. Now that the competitive landscape has settled down, investors have moved on to speculating where the next technlogical revolution will occur, and who the winners and losers will be in fields such as solar power, electric cars and biotechnology. The Internet and associated developments in mobile telephony and social media have meanwhile become an integral part of almost everyone’s life.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Looking back, the stock market’s initial reaction to the arrival of the Internet as a commercial reality was just what you would expect from studying earlier historical episodes. Investors sought to buy the potential winners and sell the losers. The problem was that this reaction was grossly over-simplified and exaggerated. On the ‘winners’ side, it meant that the valuation of any company that could even remotely be described as being part of the so-called ‘new economy’ was bid up regardless of merit. Almost any company in the TMT segments of the stock market went to sky-high valuations in what seemed like the blink of an eye. Favourable treatment was also extended to any company that could claim to have embraced the new digital world in some way. Even some sensible professional firms in law and accountancy were taken in by the hype, offering to have their fees for work undertaken for Internet start-ups paid in shares rather than cash. Most of the companies anointed as ‘winners’ fairly quickly turned out not to be winners at all.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The same initially indiscriminate treatment was meted out to the ‘losers’. Those that suffered included any company with products that could not easily have the ‘new economy’ label attached to them. It did not matter if their businesses were unlikely to be negatively impacted by the Internet. It was simply that, given that they could not be deemed to be part of the new Industrial Revolution, their share prices were marked down anyway – a case of guilt by association. While firms with plausible claims to be part of the new economy were bid up to the skies, the rest of the quoted universe of companies largely failed to participate at all. These bargain prices, ironically, provided those who owned and stuck with them much higher returns over the succeeding period than the companies whose new technology was creating so much excitement.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The research in this book strongly suggested that the winners would take many years to emerge and that only a minority of investors would be able to identify which ones they would be at such an early stage in the cycle. This has largely been borne out by experience, not least because some of the long-term winners, such as Facebook, did not even exist at the time of the peak in market valuations, but only emerged in a later stage of the cycle. Conversely, history strongly suggested that it would be possible to identify some of the losers at a relatively early stage. In reality it turned out that the markets misspecified both the winner and loser categories. The task was not made easy by the fact that, unlike most previous technology changes, there was no obvious single industry that faced being supplanted. It was not like railroads replacing canals, or the telephone replacing the telegraph.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The most obvious immediate threat was that electronic delivery of products would in time replace physical delivery wherever possible, a change that applied across a whole range of industries, not just one sector. In respect of tangible products, the threat that entirely new competitors operating with cheaper cost bases would supplant incumbents has proved to be limited. Few at the time predicted quite how dominant Amazon would become in reshaping the nature and logistics of the retail-distribution business. But while by example it has measurably transformed some aspects of retailing for everyone in the industry, it has not completely destroyed the high street, as many had expected. The best retailers have successfully adopted the new technology for their own purposes, using it to cut their storage and distribution costs and increasing their online sales. Retailers that failed to keep pace have disappeared, either through failure or in mergers with other threatened companies. Few of the online start-ups that raised money purely on the strength of promising lower costs, but enjoyed little or no retailing experience, have survived.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">A notable early example of the speculative excess was the trendy online retailer Boo.com, which raised and burned through $135m of capital before going bust only 18 months later. Boo.com offered no pricing advantage for customers and had an over-specified but under-engineered website that proved unable to fulfil the orders it did receive. Its failure should not have been a surprise. Nevertheless, in the fevered environment of the time it attracted support from such luminaries as Bernard Arnault (the head of LVMH, the luxury brand business), Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan. In essence the companies that have dealt most successfully with the threat of the Internet have simply added a thriving digital business to their existing physical retail space. The business-to-business model for tangible products meanwhile retains many of the same characteristics as before, but with new features such as online search and ordering, digital stock control and electronic payment systems – all made possible by the new technology – becoming standard across the industry. Consumers generally have benefited from the positive impact of much greater price discovery, making differentiation by price much harder for producers.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The critical test for many Internet companies came, just as the model predicted, when they needed refinancing to survive. For some, this refinancing never took place and the companies folded. For others, the price of securing further finance was the loss of independence. Just as in the early 1900s (when AT&amp;T and General Motors among others found out to their cost), evidence of a slowdown in growth or, worse, a recession, is typically enough to trigger a wave of rescue bids, as those with strong balance sheets gobble up those now desperately seeking finance to survive. This is the opportunity for well-run companies to buy their way back into the technology they have hitherto been unable to adopt by their own efforts.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Cash flow shortages, or a desire to monetise the capital created by new embryonic companies, also helps visionary companies which are further on in their development to add additional arms to their existing business. Recent history has produced many examples, such as Google’s purchase of YouTube and Facebook’s purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram. However, for every successful purchase, there are also many examples of acquisitions, distressed or otherwise, that fail to produce the desired success. Hewlett-Packard purchased Autonomy but ended up in litigation, Microsoft purchased Nokia and effectively closed the operation. News Corp’s purchase of MySpace ended up as one of the most costly failures of the new century, as the AOL Time Warner merger before it had been.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The term ‘Internet age’ might have been a useful catch-all for the TMT bubble and its aftermath but it clearly hides more than it reveals. The physical development of the Internet and its initial commercialisation was one thing but its impact on business and societal structure extends way beyond this. It might be a stretch to compare the impact to the Industrial Revolution but that should not lead one to underestimate its importance.</span> </p>
