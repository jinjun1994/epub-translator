<p><span class="style0">In 1900 the Electric Vehicle Company sought to flex its muscles with regard to the patent it had purchased, and commenced proceedings against the largest gasoline automobile manufacturer, the Winton Motor Carriage Company. The patent was upheld in the lower court, although the strength of the legal decision was open to question, as was its ultimate enforceability. The trade press of the time certainly pointed out that European developments had preceded Selden’s patent by a substantial time period and Winton’s defence cited a long list of precedents, including Lenoir.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Eventually, though, the interests of the two parties began to move together. For the Electric Vehicle Company, an extended period of litigation with an uncertain outcome was not desirable, given that its underlying operating business was haemorrhaging cash. Equally, for Winton and the other manufacturers a negotiated settlement held some attractions. Winton altruistically recounted that he pushed for the creation of a trade body to bring the industry greater credibility and to exclude stock manipulators. This being the case, a strange set of bedfellows was selected. An alternative interpretation would have seen the body as an attempt at creating a form of trust so as to attain some control over pricing in a volatile industry.</span> </p>
