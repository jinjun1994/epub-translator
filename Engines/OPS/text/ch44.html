<h1 id="anchor_1291_0"><span class="style1">The emergence of the telephone</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Alexander Graham Bell was born in Scotland in 1847. During his early life he was immersed in the science of sound, phonetics and physiology of speech. His father was one of the world’s leading elocutionists, and his mother’s hearing was severely impaired. His father was to produce the definitive text on ‘visible speech’, a universal single phonetic system, and Bell’s future interest in the electrical transmission of speech was therefore grounded in a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of speech.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Bell’s father had received strong interest in his work from America and following the tragic loss of two of their sons to tuberculosis, the family emigrated to Canada. Within 12 months Bell’s talents had secured him a teaching position in the United States, at the Boston School for the Deaf. His ability as a teacher soon brought him to the attention of the school’s patrons. In 1872 Bell took on the tuition of George Sanders, a child who had been born totally deaf, and who was the son of Thomas Sanders, a prosperous Massachusetts merchant who would play a crucial role in financing future developments. Bell’s ingenuity and knowledge of speech helped the child make huge strides in his ability to communicate.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Bell was also fascinated by the potential for transmitting sound electrically – and thus there were the main elements for creating a ‘new’ technology. First, he had a thorough understanding of a related field. Second, he had practical experience and the drive to succeed. Lastly, through connections at the School for the Deaf, he had contacts and access to both capital and management advice. Bell’s initial focus was naturally on improvements to the technology of the telegraph. This was understandable, as the telegraph dominated the communication field, and incremental improvements to the carrying capacity or the speed of transfer were clearly likely to be lucrative patents for whoever achieved them.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Bell was only one of a substantial coterie of knowledgeable researchers who sought to achieve such improvements as the duplex and later the Quadruplex. Bell pursued the development of what he called the ‘harmonic telegraph’. Before the duplex and the Quadruplex, only one message at a time could be transmitted. Bell drew parallels between multiple messages and multiple notes in a musical chord – hence the harmonic telegraph. In this he fought a race with the Western Electric scientist Elisha Gray. Bell faced a number of constraints, not least that he was combining his research with his teaching work. As an alien, he was unable to file a caveat on his work, only a full patent which in turn was only available for completed work. In 1874, Bell sought a patent from the British Crown, but was not only informed that this would not be extended to him in absentia, but also that any remuneration would be at the discretion of Her Majesty’s Postmaster General. Thus rebuffed, and without the likelihood of obtaining legal protection for his work, Bell redirected his research efforts from telegraph enhancement to subjects more directly relevant to his work as a teacher, including the reproduction of human speech.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the summer of 1874, Bell pulled together his various areas of research in an experiment which combined the use of a dead man’s ear and an intricate series of connections to a straw stylus which demonstrated the ability to translate sound into physical movement. The experiment enabled Bell to recognise that sound could be uniquely translated into an undulating current defined by its amplitude and frequency. Armed with this knowledge and the view that here was a new and improved method for telegraphy, Bell sought out the father of one of his students for advice. In October he visited Gardiner Greene Hubbard, the son of a Massachusetts Supreme Court judge and a patent attorney. Hubbard was fascinated by technology and excited by the telegraphic prospects from Bell’s work. Hubbard immediately checked the US Patent Office and found that there were at that time no competing patents. Out of the meeting with Hubbard came an equal partnership between Bell, Hubbard and Thomas Sanders, set up to fund Bell’s research. Competition was intense, and the race to establish a working model and patent would only produce one winner.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The passage of Bell’s research work on the telegraph was anything but smooth. A demonstration in March 1875 to William Orton of Western Union had proceeded smoothly in a technical sense, but had been marred by the suspicion that the process was designed only to pass information on Bell’s work to Gray. At the presentation, Orton had made clear his view that only one system would succeed and that the fact that Gray worked for Western Electric weighed heavily in his favour. Personal enmity between Orton and Hubbard also surfaced during the meeting, and it was apparent that convincing Western Union to use their invention was going to be no easy task.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Bell returned to his home from Western Union’s Broadway headquarters determined to perfect his invention and add as many functional channels as possible. During this further work he became convinced of the potential to carry the human voice and wrote to his partner Hubbard about the potential for using variable resistance to transmit undistorted signals. In June 1875, with his colleague Thomas Watson, Bell successfully transmitted sounds using induced currents. His partners were not impressed by the diversion this caused from pure development of the telegraph, but despite repeated attempts found themselves unable to constrain Bell’s enthusiasm in this direction.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In September 1875 Bell began work on the patent application for his work, to include both the improvements to the telegraph and his work on sound transmission, which ultimately become known as the telephone. In November 1875 Bell was married and the newfound need for financial security further stimulated his efforts to obtain patents. Bell initially attempted to have his work patented in Britain, and in January 1876 dispatched a gentleman with the necessary paperwork, but only on his American patent paperwork did he add a clause regarding variable resistance. This would have significance later in the courtroom battle with rival inventor Elisha Gray. Unfortunately for Bell, the patent was never filed in Britain and thus he failed to obtain protection in the richest market in the world, albeit one where communication was controlled by the public sector. On the other hand, and fortunately for Bell, frustration at Bell’s delays led the more commercially aware Hubbard to apply for patent protection. Hubbard instructed his Washington lawyers to submit the patent on Bell’s behalf to the US Patent Office. This was done on 12 February 1876.</span> </p>
