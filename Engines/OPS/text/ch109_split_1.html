<p><span class="style0">The results of the 1903 conference proved inconclusive, but as Marconi’s influence grew so did the pressure to remove the monopoly implied by the non-communication policy. Some said there were implications for shipping safety. While this was true, the main thrust of the criticism at the second conference (called in 1906) remained commercial and national. This time the pressure exerted by the American delegates was sufficient to ensure that Marconi would lose the battle and the British government would give way, eventually passing legislation to require inter-communication. For Marconi, the impact was mitigated somewhat by the subsidy granted in return for the change in contracts by the British government. The thrust of his business continued to be the same, to improve the reliability and capability of his radio equipment. This took the form of creating the diode valve by Fleming, which preceded De Forest’s triode or audion, and later the purchase of patents from Oliver Lodge to avoid potential litigation relating to previous advances which embodied Lodge’s work.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The purchase of patents which might otherwise inhibit his commercial application also took place in America. In 1885, Thomas Edison had conducted his space telegraphy tests and in 1891 had received a patent for this work, entitled ‘Means for transmitting signals electrically’. Either through the pressing needs of other work, or because he had not believed in their commercial or technical potential, Edison had not pursued this work. For this reason, despite the apparent success of Marconi in transmitting signals across the English Channel and then the Atlantic, he was willing to assign his patents to Marconi for a fee. The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America paid Edison $60,000 ($4m) for the rights to Edison’s radio patents.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The five years after the loss of the non-communication policy were financially difficult ones for the Marconi companies. Forced to self-fund development of the transatlantic service, Marconi quickly found that capital was scarce and fiscal austerity was necessary to conserve scarce cash resources. As a consequence, research and development was kept to a bare minimum. What development there was related to small incremental improvements to existing services. In 1908 Marconi was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics jointly with Ferdinand Braun, but the £8,000 prize ($2.3m) was only a brief ray of light. The task facing Marconi was the simple one of gaining profitability. The route to achieving this lay in two parts. First, agreement had to be reached with competitors where possible. In early 1910 a new jointly owned company was formed with Telefunken in Germany to handle the two companies’ German merchant shipping interests and avoid any future patent disputes. The second element was protection, and in particular attacking patent infringement. As Fessenden had found, litigation was an expensive process, even when eventually successful. Up to 1910, the Marconi companies had not wished to devote resources to this. With the start of the new decade, though, this policy changed and Marconi aggressively pursued patent infringement. This met with real success and considerably reduced competition as a consequence.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The success was assisted by the actions of others. The United Wireless Telegraph Company had seen its reputation increasingly tarnished as the press exposed its stock-selling methods, questioning both its claims and its financial viability. The company’s importance as the main supplier to the US Navy helped prompt an investigation by the Justice Department. That investigation revealed fraud on a massive scale and in May 1911 the main company officers received prison sentences as a consequence. This left United Wireless as an irresistible target, so Marconi launched a patent infringement suit. Without top management, and as the likely loser of the suit, the United Wireless Company was in no position to defend itself. In 1912, control of the beleaguered company passed to Marconi in a takeover dressed up as a merger. As a consequence, the Marconi companies now achieved the desired competitive position with a dominant market share in the British Empire and the North American continent. For the first time, the company was actually in a position to become profitable.</span> </p>
