<p><span class="style0">If Babbage’s machines were stillborn, the same could not be said of a successor machine, the cash register. The cash register was first developed by James Ritty in 1879. It was developed in response to Ritty’s frustration with thefts by staff in his restaurant and was given the less than catchy title: ‘Ritty’s Incorruptible Cashier’. Few of these new machines were sold, although one customer, a struggling coal merchant named John Patterson, was to play an important role in spreading its use. Patterson was sufficiently impressed with the potential economic value of the register business that he sold all his coal interests to fund his expansion into the new mechanical device which displayed and recorded sales totals.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">What Ritty lacked, but Patterson did not, was a devotion to selling. In 1884, Patterson bought Ritty’s company and renamed it the National Cash Register Company. He quickly introduced a wide range of innovations and incentives for his sales force, copying and improving on ‘best’ current sales practice. Salesmen were heavily incentivised through high commissions; training was introduced, sales literature was prepared and direct marketing to potential customers employed to generate interest. In addition to a professional and aggressive sales force, NCR sought to provide customer support through the establishment of a retail-distribution chain. Patterson also realised that the technology could not remain static. He therefore set up a department charged with the task of constant improvement to the registers. For the first 40 years of its life, NCR enjoyed phenomenal success in manufacturing and selling cash registers. It ruthlessly protected its dominant market position, even setting up a subsidiary to protect it from the companies sprouting up to sell secondhand registers.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In 1903 a successful young salesman named Thomas Watson was called to NCR headquarters where he was informed that he was to run NCR’s secondhand operation. The principal goal of this operation was to undercut its competitors and put them out of business. Watson proved highly successful in this role, and was rapidly promoted to the point where by 1910 he was effectively Patterson’s number two. Unfortunately for Patterson and Watson, the tactics that had been used to protect their market became the subject of an investigation instigated by one of their competitors, the American Cash Register Company. In 1910, with antitrust feeling running at its strongest, Patterson and Watson were found guilty, fined $5,000 and sentenced to one year’s <span id="anchor_3350_121"></span>incarceration.<a href="ch135.html#anchor_3640_0">⁷⁷</a> The verdict was overturned on appeal. In the meantime, public opinion had begun to swing behind the company as a result of its humanitarian efforts to counter a local natural disaster.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Relief at this reversal was short-lived for Watson – soon after, the axe fell on him, just as it had on so many other of Patterson’s protégés. Watson took his sales training and expertise to the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and set about developing a business to rival that of NCR. Unlike NCR, whose client base had been in the commercial sector, the business that Watson joined had its genesis in the public sector, in the dull but lucrative business of census enumeration. NCR meanwhile continued to go from strength to strength, culminating in a massive IPO in 1924 which despite its size was five-times oversubscribed, attracting subscriptions of over $250m ($6bn). This made it the largest new issue in history at the time.</span> </p>
