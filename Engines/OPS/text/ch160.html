<p><span class="style0">The early development of Cisco was funded by the couple’s mortgage and credit cards, but such was the latent demand that it quickly established sales in excess of $250,000 per month. Their efforts to develop the business were supported by colleagues, some of whom threw in their lot with the operation, working incredibly long hours in cramped conditions to try and meet demand. In 1986, the operation moved to its own premises, but remained a relatively amateurish business. Advertising took place via email and word of mouth. The business was constrained by lack of capital and management. As a consequence, the couple decided to try and raise additional funds. Despite their early commercial success they did not find a receptive audience. The venture capital world remained more interested in the PC industry. As a consequence, they were rejected by the first 75 venture capital companies they approached. Eventually, after many failed presentations, Sequoia Capital agreed to provide $3m in return for a one-third equity stake. Sequoia also installed John Morgridge as CEO.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The timing of this investment could not have been better, with product demand entering an explosive upward curve. With a readily available product and no meaningful competitors, the company prospered immediately. It was not just growth, though, that was explosive, with violent personality clashes between the founders and the new management team. One thing all parties did agree on was that it would be an ideal time to take the company public. Cisco came to the market in 1990. The business continued to prosper and expand, although the original founders were ousted soon after, following an irreconcilable breakdown in relations between staff and Sandy Lerner. The couple sold their two-thirds stake in Cisco for $170m. Len Bosack also decided to leave.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Although the initial reaction to the IPO was lukewarm, Cisco never looked back, thanks to its dominant position as a provider of intranet infrastructure. If Cisco had been in the railroad business, it would have been as the provider, installer and maintainer of rails, signalling equipment and timetables. As such, it benefited directly from the growth in networks, and both as a supplier of physical items such as routers and the owner of the source code of its Internetwork Operating System (IOS). This was the essential software to ensure compatibility between products, and Cisco had learned from the example of Microsoft how important it was for this code to become the industry standard. In addition, Cisco repeatedly acquired companies that appeared to be developing complementary technologies, and attempted to add these new business streams to its operations. These acquisitions were made substantially easier by a stock market that had gradually woken up to Cisco’s prospects and was ready to give the company a higher valuation, consistent with accelerating expectations of Internet growth. The ‘bubble’ element built into the company’s valuation of its peak was only to be deflated as the market’s TMT bubble burst in 2000.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Cisco’s financial history is reminiscent of that of many other technology companies in times past and follows a familiar pattern. In the early stages, when the company has a technological lead, or meaningful patent protection, sales and profits increase at a rapid pace. The return on equity and assets rises accordingly. At some point, however, the company finds that, as market penetration increases, or as its technological lead is reduced, pricing assumes increasing importance. Sales growth slows and margins flatten. In such a scenario, the only ways to maintain previous rates of profit growth are to decrease the equity base or use increased debt to fund additional growth through acquisitions. When one has the market share commanded by Cisco, the room for manoeuvre is relatively narrow and strategy tends to veer towards warding off threats.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Given the unavoidable constraints presented by its size, the company has shown itself to be a proven survivor and an impressively managed business. Return on capital has inevitably declined but earnings per share have continued to grow thanks to buybacks and acquisitions. The company has clearly become more vulnerable to the ups and downs of the economic cycle. Nevertheless, Cisco has largely managed to maintain its margins at a remarkably high level for such a mature business. Market maturity may not be the most significant challenge it faces. If new entrants are successful in breaking into the software element of Cisco’s business then this would expose the company to commoditisation of its hardware. Industry shifts to cloud services are concentrating the customer base, changing the balance of power and making Cisco vulnerable to a new, tougher pricing environment. It is hard to argue that the market is unaware of these challenges and what really stands out from its share price history is the valuation aberration of the TMT bubble period.</span> </p>
