<h1 id="anchor_4110_0"><span class="style1">Something stirs in academia</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Even as the first electronic computers were being introduced, scientists were already speculating on the potential gains that could be had from linking them together. The two principal groups to show interest were the defence sector and academia. In defence, the realm from which mainframe computing had emerged, the nuclear age extended computing demands beyond shipping and ballistics. Computers soon became an integrated part of the nuclear defence command-and-control system. This required the creation of a network of computers and links between dedicated mainframes in defence establishments and those in the research facilities of defence academics. In the case of academics, demand for access to mainframes extended well beyond those directly involved in government-funded defence work. The difficulty was that mainframe computers were expensive to purchase, install and maintain. They could only be justified as purchases by the collective needs of many academic departments and users. There were thus strategic reasons why mainframe computers should be networked in defence, and economic ones in academia.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">At a more futuristic level, many individuals could see the potential for linking computers and the benefits that might accrue as a result. The earliest and most important statement of intent came at the end of World War II from Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development in the US. In Britain, as we saw in chapter 8, Winston Churchill followed the conventional British approach of maintaining as much secrecy as possible about defence matters, thereby inhibiting the spread of knowledge and expertise gained at establishments such as Bletchley Park during World War II. Bush took the opposite approach. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, at Bush’s instigation, requested a report on the future direction of military and scientific research. Bush, a founder of the American Appliance Company (later to become Raytheon), delivered the report, entitled ‘Science: The Endless Frontier’, to President Roosevelt in July 1945. The report was to define the framework for the development of technology in America in the second half of the 20th century.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Bush argued that America could no longer rely on Europe for fundamental research; that the government had to coordinate and sponsor research activities but allow private sector and academic involvement; that future technological superiority should be attained not by restriction of information but by its dissemination; and that a new body funded by Congress and named the National Research Foundation should be established. This foundation would be controlled by civilians and support basic university research in medicine and the natural sciences, as well as weapons research for the armed forces.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This proved a visionary report. It not only helped create a body that would play an important role in future technological development, but also provided a powerful impetus to the dissemination of research conducted during the war, encouraging potential use by the private sector. The commercial deployment of research from World War II in America distinguished it from other developed nations. This concept of private/public partnership and central funding for research was to underpin the development of the new information age, although implementing Bush’s vision was far from a smooth and orderly process. The 1947 Act setting up a National Research Foundation was vetoed by President Truman. The National Science Foundation that eventually emerged in 1950 differed somewhat from Bush’s original conception, and Bush himself opposed it. It departed from his ideas in that research was not coordinated by the new foundation as a single body, nor was it involved in military-related research. The NSF also had a limited remit and funds.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The main research-funding bodies of the time were the Office of Naval Research and the Atomic Energy Commission. These bodies grew in importance with the Korean War, but it was the intensification of the Cold War that provided the real impetus for funding military computing applications. While the promotion of a national science-funding body was one of Bush’s enduring contributions, the conditions of the time ensured that the military maintained control for the foreseeable future. Bush wrote a visionary article in July 1945 in</span> <span class="style1">Atlantic Monthly</span> <span class="style0">entitled ‘As We May Think’. Much of this was devoted to advances in photography and the role this might play in the storage and retrieval of information. A further portion dealt with retailing and point-of-sale information-gathering. Interesting as these discussions were, they simply extrapolated existing scientific knowledge to potential applications, and in any event were soon made redundant by the advance of technology.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The final and most prophetic part of the article, however, described a machine called the ‘memex’, which would allow information to be stored in a manner that better mimicked human needs. Rather than a hierarchical indexing system, Bush discussed a new system in which stored data or text was cross-referenced by association. This is the way, he pointed out, that the human mind operates. “With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with an intricate web of trails. Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made, with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client’s interest…There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing trails which lead him all over civilisation at a particular <span id="anchor_4122_189"></span>epoch.”<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4880_0">⁹⁵</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Just as the NSF took many years to appear, and did so in a somewhat different form from Bush’s original conception, so too the functionality associated with the memex was to take decades to appear. It did, though – at least in part – appear at last in the form of the Internet and the World Wide Web, the 21st century’s encyclopedia of choice. Its appearance, though, proved largely a by-product of network development, and owed more to the military imperatives of the intervening period than to any direct attempt to bring Bush’s vision to reality.</span> </p>
