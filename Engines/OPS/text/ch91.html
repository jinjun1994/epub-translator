<p><span class="style0">The structure of the industry in the early years was inherently unstable. The barriers to new entrants were relatively low. The technological hurdle was simply the ability to design and produce an automobile from subcontracted parts. Although this was not a straightforward task it was within the reach of many. The techniques of automobile production were still in their infancy and the process was effectively one of assembly of subcontracted parts. In a period of a relatively benign economic environment, neither were there significant capital hurdles. So long as production could be pre-sold and suppliers were willing to extend credit, the seed capital and the ongoing working capital did not represent an insurmountable obstacle. The risk for new entrants was therefore relatively low, and in an industry that was both growing and attracting attention the result was pretty much what would have been expected.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The industry in America also benefited from the protection from European imports of a 45%</span> <span class="style1">ad valorem</span> <span class="style0">duty under the Payne-Aldrich tariff. Under such conditions over 500 new automobile manufacturers were attracted into the industry in America in under ten years. Many of these new competitors never produced meaningful numbers of automobiles. Tighter definitions suggest that perhaps 200 companies made serious attempts to build production in America. Interestingly, although there was a large number of entrants and departures from the industry, from the very early days production was concentrated in the top 20% of producers. As can be seen in figure 6.10, the top 18 companies represented roughly 20% of the number of producers and over 80% of the output. This level of concentration was to remain but with two caveats. First, the total number of producers shrank through consolidation and failure. Second, many of the early top 20% of companies were displaced; it was only as demand grew over the next ten years that a ‘top’ place became relatively entrenched.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">While the conditions encouraged new entrants, they did not encourage stability. The finances of most companies were extremely fragile unless they were supported by a parent with a steady cash flow from a different line of business. Any downturn in the economy or shock to the financial system would have disastrous effects on a company whose survival depended upon the gap between supplier credit and customer payment.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Notwithstanding these dangers, the industry supported a large number of players in the first decade of the 20th century. Figure 6.10 is not an exhaustive list of the US producers of the time but it gives a clear picture of how fragmented the market was. There were over 80 producers and the average number of cars sold barely exceeded 100.</span> </p>
