<p><span class="style0">AOL provided access to the World Wide Web, Netscape made achieving that access easier and Yahoo (and subsequently Google) allowed users to find the things they were looking for. The major gains made by these early companies were about information access. The creation of Amazon took the process a stage further and provided a model for the commercial sale of products on the Web. Amazon was the creation of Jeff Bezos, a Princeton engineering and computer science graduate. Bezos had worked with a small financial telecommunications company named Fitel for a couple of years, before moving to Bankers Trust fiduciary services in 1988, where he looked after the installation of a communications network for Bankers Trust customers. This network allowed the bank’s clients to view their accounts electronically, an advanced move for the time and one which some banks still do not offer despite the advance of technology in the intervening years.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Again, after a couple of years, Bezos moved on – this time to a Wall Street quantitative hedge fund named D. E. Shaw. Bezos was appointed to investigate investing opportunities in the emergent Internet in 1993. The result of his research was a list of products most suitable for sale and distribution on the net. At the top of this list was books, for a number of powerful reasons. Unlike music, the production of books was fragmented, meaning undue market power did not reside with a small number of publishing houses. No two booksellers held a combined market share of more than 25% within the US and no global brand existed. Although there was no concentration in either production or sales, the same was not the case in distribution, with a small number of companies controlling the majority of US book distribution. Although there were literally millions of books in print, there was an international cataloguing system already in operation. Finally, a book was the same no matter what shop it came from, meaning the consumer would be largely indifferent to where it was purchased. Putting all this together suggested a market opening for an Internet-based bookselling business that could operate at a much lower point on the cost curve by removing much of the need for inventory and almost all of the need for prime real estate. Despite the apparent power of the business case, Shaw rejected the proposal. Bezos decided that the opportunity was simply too good to resist and resigned to pursue it.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Bezos decided that his new company had to be located near a major book distribution facility and in a state with a low population (to maximise the client base not subject to sales tax). He decided to settle the business in the state of Washington. The company name reflected the perceived need to pick a name close to the start of the alphabet because of the alphabetic listing process on the Internet; Amazon was selected, with a ‘.com’ attached at the end to signify the new nature of the business. (The original name of Cadabra Inc, incorporated in July 1994, was jettisoned because it sounded too much like cadaver – not ideal for a growth company.) What followed was the hiring of a small number of staff and building the supporting software infrastructure on which the future business was to be based. By July 1995 sales had begun, although a number of the systems, particularly the one relating to payment, were rudimentary. The business was developed in a textbook manner, with the various aspects being analysed and tested before implementation. It absorbed substantial capital as cash flowed out to pay salaries and development costs. Bezos and his family had funded the early development, but by the summer of 1995 the business was within two months of burning through all available cash.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As a consequence Bezos sought potential investors. The process was a long one as sceptical investors had to be persuaded of the potential. By the end of 1995 Amazon had raised roughly $1m at an implied valuation of $5m. The early difficulty in raising capital began to dissipate as the growth in the Internet and the stock market success of other Internet ventures drew in additional capital. It was not long before Bezos was being cold-called by potential professional investors, beginning in 1996 with a group named General Atlantic Capital Partners. The increasing publicity garnered by Amazon, combined with the company’s sales growth and the new wave of interest in Internet investing, allowed Bezos to raise capital on more advantageous terms than many new businesses. Effectively Bezos was able to hold an auction between General Atlantic and Kleiner Perkins, which ended with a capital injection of $8m on a business valuation of $60m. This final figure was some six times higher than the initial bid made when the beauty parade began.</span> </p>
