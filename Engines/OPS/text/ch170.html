<p><span class="style0">Given the history of innovation and the competitive nature of emergent technologies it is not a surprise that ‘search’ followed the same pattern as many previous innovations, with a process of fierce competitive struggle ending with the emergence of a dominant player. Archie, Veronica, Jughead, the World Wide Wanderer, Aliweb, Excite, Galaxy, Dmoz, LookSmart, WebCrawler, Lycos, Infoseek, Inktomi, Ask Jeeves, alltheweb and Altavista were just some of the directory or search-related applications or companies that emerged over the period. Eventually they failed, were subsumed within competitors, or became specialist niche players in a world dominated by Google.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The history of Google is almost a caricature of how a business is created in Silicon Valley. It was conceived in academia, nurtured in Stanford, given initial shape in a garage, early-stage funded with private money, turned down by possible partners and/or acquirers and then later funded by experienced tech venture capitalists before it had found a clear revenue model. Google’s fast and seemingly irresistible rise to dominance in search has been chronicled in many studies, but although well known, some of the key elements are worth highlighting in the context of this book. The story begins with Sergey Brin and Larry Page, two graduate students in computer science at Stanford. Both had backgrounds in mathematics and computer science and both had academic parents in the sciences. A Stanford facility, ironically funded by Bill Gates, became the early home for the work that was to form Google. It was an environment specifically designed to encourage innovation and collaborative thought, and the initial driving focus, as far as Brin and Page were concerned, was intellectual rather than commercial.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For the two graduate students, the roadmap to a PhD required original research, with the starting point being the particular task or theory to be addressed. Given the emergence of the Internet and the growth of information residing on it, designing a tool to find the defined information represented both a logical topic for study and one that might have commercial potential. It was also an area in which numerous academics had dabbled, if only to aid them in their own research. The most striking element of the Google story is that the founders’ entire focus in the early stages was not on the business opportunity, but rather the challenge of creating the fastest search engine possible. Design was therefore uniformly directed to this end and not subverted or undermined by incorporating features to enhance revenue. Indeed, as far as one can see from the outside, potential revenue formed little part of the early decision-making process.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The genesis of how Google searches the Internet lies in the roots of the academic system – in the frequently used epithet ‘publish or perish’. Advancement in academia is heavily driven by the output of papers in refereed academic journals. As importantly, there is a hierarchy of journals (quality) which is accompanied by the number of citations received (volume) from other academic papers. The more prestigious the journal and the more citations received, the more important an academic publication is deemed to be. The peak of this particular mountain is reached when a publication comes to be described as ‘seminal’. The point is that adding up and weighting the number of citations has always been viewed in academia as independent measure of the worth of a publication.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This was precisely the methodology adopted by Google for search, with one important adjustment. As Brin and Page pointed out in their <span id="anchor_4456_23"></span>paper,<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4888_0">¹⁰³</a> “unlike academic papers which are scrupulously reviewed, Web pages proliferate free of quality control or publishing costs”. Moreover, since the Web is a commercial venture, participants are incentivised to dupe search engines. A substitute method was therefore required to replace the quality control of academic refereeing. Like all true insights, the answer was straightforward in principle: volume of citations weighted by quality of citation. The proxy for ‘quality of citation’ was taken to be the number of links to the particular website. As an example, Brin and Page noted that because the Yahoo website had so many backlinks, the implication was that it was important and therefore should carry a higher weight. Reflecting Larry Page’s insight, it was named the ‘PageRank’.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This is not to say that translating this into practical use was easy. Web content was growing exponentially and, like all true-life situations, the data would be messy and incomplete, requiring all sorts of innovative solutions and workarounds. On top of this, downloading the entire Web so that it could be subjected to their Web crawling and indexing system was a non-trivial task. The volume of data this required was what led Page and Brin to choose the name ‘Google’, a misspelling of the mathematical term ‘googol’, meaning one followed by 100 zeroes. Nevertheless, as their published work revealed, even in the early stages the Google search engine, was distinguished by both its accuracy and its speed. The comparison between Google and Altavista, another search engine, was detailed in the paper and was as striking as it was intended to be.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">What then followed had historic precedent and might be termed the ‘Decca effect’, after the recording company of that name which famously turned down the opportunity to sign the Beatles. Other precedents include Western Union turning down Bell and Marconi turning down Logie Baird. Google sought to raise funding to continue development and approached the search company whose results it had analysed and found second-best, Altavista, in the hope of licensing its technology. Perhaps DEC, Altavista’s parent, was unwilling to use external technology, or perhaps its own impending merger with Compaq diverted attention, but either way Google was spurned. This was repeated by other search engines – including Yahoo, for which the Google engine would have been a natural enhancement to its own directory-based structure.</span> </p>
