<p><span class="style0">The first public showing of Bell’s invention came at the Philadelphia Centennial, a grand scientific convention displaying the latest inventions of the period. The Centennial was opened by President Ulysses S. Grant and Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil on 10 May 1876. Nestling among other inventions of the time, such as the first grain binder, Elisha Gray’s musical telegraph and Western Union’s printing telegraphs, Bell’s invention might have gone unnoticed were it not for the intervention of the Emperor of Brazil. Having visited his class for deaf mutes at Boston University, Dom Pedro knew Bell and was interested to see what he was exhibiting. His interest stimulated that of others, including Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), a fellow Scot and one of the pre-eminent scientists and authorities on electricity. Bell explained the theory behind his work, first demonstrating his improvements to the telegraphic apparatus.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">3.4 – Stimulating interest: Bell markets his new invention</span> </p>
<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style1">Scientific American</span><span class="style0">, 31 March 1877.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">He then explained ‘undulatory theory’, and offered to provide a rudimentary test run. This involved Bell moving to a different room and speaking to both Thomson and Dom Pedro. For the record, the transmission was Hamlet’s soliloquy and the distance was 100 yards. The assembled audience cheered in response and Bell received both a glowing report from the exhibition’s panel of judges and a medal award for his telephone. This award came despite Gray’s protests to the panel judges that Bell’s invention could not have used electrical current for sound transmission and must have been acoustic in nature. Despite this success, public reaction ranged from unimpressed to dismissive. The</span> <span class="style1">Times</span> <span class="style0">in London, for example, described Bell’s offering as “the latest example of American humbug”. Many scientists of the day were as sceptical as Gray, describing it variously as either a hoax or an irrelevance. For Bell and his backers, the next stage was to take the invention from a rudimentary working model to a viable commercial entity. In order to achieve this, they needed enough support to finance the new venture and encourage subscribers to make use of the telephone.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The initial scepticism that greeted the telephone was demonstrated by the difficulty Bell’s colleagues had in raising funds to develop the business. Bell was forced to spend much of his time marketing the new invention, to convince potential backers as to its technical viability and its practical use. Public demonstrations were set up in the presence of venerable scientists, such as Sir William Thomson connecting Boston and New York and conducting a conversation between Bell and Watson. In October 1876 they followed this up with demonstrations between Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Bell’s marketing campaign included such ‘stunts’ as using 16 Yale professors rather than a wire and letting the current carrying his conversation flow through their bodies. Despite these efforts, it took until May 1877 for the first telephones to be leased. The sum paid was $20 ($1,500). By August the number of telephones in use had expanded to 778 and it became necessary to enter into a more formal business agreement. The Bell Telephone Association was created, with Bell, Hubbard and Sanders each receiving 30% of the shares and Thomas Watson 10%. At that time the venture had no subscribed capital; it had effectively been bankrolled by Sanders, who had signed notes totalling in excess of $110,000 (nearly $10m) and was himself close to bankruptcy.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The investing environment of the time was not conducive to raising capital. Recent great leaps forward in technology had created an earlier bubble; when this burst, it resulted in substantial losses for many investors, leaving the public soured with promises of future advances. Even though Bell’s demonstrations attracted favourable press comment, funds were not readily forthcoming. The disasters, bankruptcies and scandals that followed the financing of the railroads were still fresh in investors’ minds. It required more than a concept, however well marketed, to attract funds. The euphoria which surrounded the railroads and which allowed both the overbuilding and the lack of financial or management controls had evaporated.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Investing opinion was hesitant to invest generally, and sceptical on Bell’s particular invention. Few seemed to share Bell’s view that the telephone would one day replace the telegraph. The best encapsulation of the prevailing opinion of the time is the fact that Western Union, the company that was best placed to understand the commercial importance of fast and accurate information transfer, dismissed the telephone as an irrelevance. In 1876 the Bell consortium, disheartened by their inability to raise capital, turned to Western Union and offered to sell Bell’s patents for $100,000 (just over $8m). Western Union’s president, William Orton, declined the offer, on the grounds that he could not see a viable commercial use for the telephone. “What use,” he asked pleasantly, “could this company make of an electrical <span id="anchor_1327_130"></span>toy?”<a href="ch51.html#anchor_1510_0">²⁴</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">A more detailed reaction can be seen from the minutes of the meeting that considered Bell’s offer:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“The telephone is so named by its inventor A. G. Bell. He believes that one day they will be installed in every residence and place of business. Bell’s profession is that of a voice teacher. Yet he claims to have discovered an instrument of great practical value in communication which has been overlooked by thousands of workers who have spent years in the field. Bell’s proposals to place his instrument in every home and business is fantastic. The central exchange alone would represent a huge outlay in real estate and buildings, to say nothing of the electrical equipment. In conclusion, the committee feels that it must advise against any investments in Bell’s scheme. We do not doubt that it will find users in special circumstances, but any development of the kind and scale Bell so fondly imagines is utterly out of the <span id="anchor_1331_143"></span>question.”<a href="ch51.html#anchor_1511_0">²⁵</a></span> </p>
