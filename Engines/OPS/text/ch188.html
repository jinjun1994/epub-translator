<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Technological change has been a more or less constant feature of modern industrial life since the latter years of the 18th century. It has been the driving force behind productivity growth, the creator of new products and the facilitator that has opened up new markets for existing products. All of these effects are key elements in investment decision-making and portfolio management. In general, identifying the winning technology comes much earlier than identifying the winning companies. This means that the ‘losers’ become clearer much earlier so long as one first understands the direction of technology and the areas that will be impacted by its deployment.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There are periods when technological change is largely incremental, simply extending what has gone before. These periods are not ones that tend to create wholescale shifts in stock market valuations. Other periods of change, however, can be fairly described as revolutionary. These tend to be the times when a technology is first introduced. These periods do create wholescale shifts in valuations and can be of fundamental importance. If they develop into ‘bubble periods’, as has happened on several occasions, the initial reaction is either exaggerated or incorrect and is eventually replaced by a more sober assessment when economic reality reasserts itself. Whatever the outcome, the investor has to try to understand both what is happening and where it is likely to develop in the future.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">In hindsight the course of progress towards ever faster, more efficient and more useful machines seems effortless and inexorable. Yet one of the first things that strikes the historian, and struck me at once in my research, was how haphazard the timing and pace of technological development often is. It also soon became clear that the process of capital-raising and the interaction between entrepreneurs, innovators and financial markets has often followed a bumpy and convoluted path. The emergence of the Internet as an agent of change in the modern world is no different in this respect from any other so-called great technological breakthrough of the recent past, although there are also some unique features of the Internet bubble that mark it out from other similar episodes. This concluding chapter summarises some of the lessons of recent experience and the implications for investors and the economy, based on a model of how technology, change and markets interact.</span> </p>
