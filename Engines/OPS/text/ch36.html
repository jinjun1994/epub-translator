<h1 id="anchor_1125_0"><span class="style1">Conclusions</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The railways of Britain and America followed slightly different paths, but there were many similarities. In both cases their economic superiority caused the respective canal networks to gradually fall into disuse. The canals made attempts to stop the advance of the railways and when this failed they sought to improve their own efficiency. Unfortunately for holders of their stock, the additional capital they expended was ultimately in vain and as a consequence their stock prices took on an inexorable decline. In both America and Britain, the early railways demonstrated their profitability in such a convincing manner that the initially sceptical investors were quickly won over. The ‘losers’ from the new technology were therefore relatively easy to spot, in that horse-drawn carriages and canals had been superseded by a more cost-efficient competitor. So far as the ‘winners’ were concerned, identification proved more difficult.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In both countries the first companies unsurprisingly sought to take advantage of the most lucrative routes. These routes normally involved connections between product producers and consumers, or between existing urban areas. They normally also connected points where there was no competition in place. Such opportunities were limited and as new companies came into existence the first round of competition took place between the new railways and traditional carriers, whether canals, coastal ships or horse-drawn transport. When these opportunities were exhausted, the next round involved either seeking to develop new markets or competing with established railways. By this time investors typically were less sceptical on prospects and funding was relatively easy to obtain. It would be possible to turn this round and argue the opposite: that when investors were in a period of optimism typically associated with general prosperity, new ventures were put forward, many of which lacked the compelling economic logic of their predecessors.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In an environment where capital was relatively easy to obtain, the financial markets quickly became awash with new companies that were only too happy to soak up this relatively undiscriminating excess liquidity. The proprietors and promoters of some of these companies fell into the unscrupulous category and to the extent that supervision of their activities was less than vigilant, or the law was open to abuse, the companies quickly became vehicles for private speculation and personal advancement. In Britain the most obvious example was George Hudson, although his greatest crime was arguably fraudulently favourable accounts and excess dividend payments, which helped to stoke the optimism attached to railway ventures. These actions were not governed by statute and it was illegal personal enrichment that eventually brought him down.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In America, where legal and financial structures were still relatively immature, the excesses were worse. Foreign investors were unable to exercise control and turned to the emerging breed of financiers in the US to seek protection from the speculation that had enveloped the market. J. P. Morgan and others tried to bring order to a chaotic market. This was not an easy task, and repeated attempts to bring an end to the price wars all met with relative failure. The largest customers of the railroads were able to dictate terms and effectively enjoyed subsidies against their competitors. Long-suffering farmers continued to find themselves at the mercy of the railroads. The backlash against this behaviour was eventually to culminate in a series of antitrust laws which would be repeatedly employed against monopolies, both real and imagined.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The result of the speculation in railroads and the euphoria that surrounded their prospects was that by the 1880s almost double the amount of track required had been laid. By the mid-1870s, almost 40% of American railroad bonds were in default and by 1879 some $234m ($19bn) had foreclosed. In the six years up to 1879, it is estimated that European investors alone lost some $600m ($50bn) as a result of bankruptcies and fraud. The most striking modern parallel is probably with the lack of discrimination often shown towards investing in emerging markets. There are many countries where the legal regulation of corporate activity still falls short of what was in place in America at the time of the robber barons. In many countries, the law of property rights is not enshrined in a robust legal framework, independent of the arm of government and factionalism. China and Russia are two obvious examples. This is very similar to the prevailing environment of 19th-century America. Property rights existed, but they could be bent by the whim of corruptible judges and local politicians. The United States was undoubtedly the greater emerging market at the time, but few equity investors prospered in such a market.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">British investors in railroads took a somewhat different approach to their investments in American railroads from their Continental European cousins. The British concentration was mainly on routes between established centres of economic activity. The finance houses brought the stock of such companies to the market and agents in America monitored and reported back on their progress. In addition, a number of collective investment vehicles were put in place to allow smaller private investors to spread their risks. Many of these investment companies and investment trusts are still in operation today; in them lie the roots of the modern mutual fund industry. The popularity of American investment helped the development of this industry, but it should be noted that a number of the trusts formed to provide a portfolio approach to investing in the emerging nation of America took advantage of the demand to allow preferential rates of return to their founders, who were also the trustees, well in excess of those available to the normal subscriber.</span> </p>
