<title>The impact of Henry Ford - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<h1 id="anchor_2429_0"><span class="style1">The impact of Henry Ford</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The early battle was fought on two fronts. First the product needed to be developed, and secondly it needed to be marketed. The marketing tools were mainly the use of the press, through speed and endurance trials. This may explain why Henry Ford initially appeared to be caught between the production of racing cars and the development of vehicles for commercial sales. Ford had gained his engineering background working first on steam engines with the Westinghouse Engine Company and later climbing to the post of chief engineer at the Edison Illuminating Company (later Detroit Edison). He had been encouraged in his fixation with the automobile in a meeting with Thomas Edison and spent all his spare time working on a vehicle.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Eventually the manager of the Edison Illuminating Company offered Ford a further promotion to general superintendent, but only on the condition that he gave up his misguided experimentation with the automobile. By this time Ford had a working version of his automobile and through the connections he had established with parties interested in his work he was able to leave the employment of Edison and set up the Detroit Automobile Company in 1899. Notwithstanding that the backers put up capital of $15,000 (over $1million) it was still a brave move by Ford, who left behind secure compensation, worth well in excess of $100,000 in today’s terms. Unfortunately the backers of the venture desired a relatively rapid return, whereas Ford wished to spend substantial time on experimentation. The difference in outlook left the venture in difficulties. Within 12 months Ford had left and the company had folded.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Without backers Ford needed to demonstrate his abilities. His route was to develop a racing car. The industry backdrop was the endurance demonstrations of the cars produced by Alexander Winton and Ransom Olds. Between late 1899 and 1901 Ford conserved his finances by living with his father in an effort to complete his racing automobile. In October 1901 Ford took to the race track against the undoubted favourite and then world speed record holder, Alexander Winton. Twenty-five miles later Ford crossed the winning line, taking the crystal trophy, and perhaps more importantly the $1,000 ($70,000) first prize.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Winning the race against the pioneering Scot had the desired effect and the publicity it generated attracted backers and $30,000 ($2m) for a new company that was named the Henry Ford Company. Unfortunately the disagreements of the previous venture were now repeated. The backers who controlled the company required a production car that could be sold to the public, but Ford wished to work on a racing car. The owners of the company brought in a gentleman by the name of Henry Leland to ensure their wishes were followed and as a consequence Ford left. Leland, a well-known and respected Detroit engineer, then took control of the company and proceeded to produce an automobile called the Cadillac. Henry Ford’s response to again being on his own was to follow the path which had worked for him once before. He built another racing car named the ‘999’ and beat Alexander Winton in another race. In this instance it was the 1903 Challenge Cup.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The result of this new victory was again sufficient publicity to attract potential investors. Ford was approached by a Scotsman named Alexander Malcomson, a powerful and wealthy coal merchant in Detroit. Through Malcomson the funds were raised to form the Ford Motor Company. John and Horace Dodge agreed to assist in the creation of the company by accepting stock in return for the supply of components. Dodge Brothers was a prominent supplier of chassis, engines and transmissions and while the 10% of the company which Ford had to offer them eventually led to recrimination and litigation, without their early support Ford could never have succeeded. In this way Ford managed to raise $28,000 ($1.7m) from Malcomson and the supply of components from the Dodge brothers.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The final result was some way short of the $100,000 and total control that Ford had asked for, but nevertheless the new Ford Motor Company, Ford’s third attempt to set up a viable automobile business, had begun. In addition to funds, Malcomson also provided practical assistance to Ford, through bringing him into contact with James Couzens, his general counsel. Couzens helped Ford in negotiations with suppliers, including the notoriously difficult and blunt Dodge brothers. Couzens himself was sufficiently excited by the prospects for the company that he borrowed enough funds to invest $2,500 ($160,000) in the venture.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the beginning the whole operation was relatively rough and ready, with engines being loaded on a horse-drawn wagon at the Dodge Brothers factory and moved to the Ford assembly site. The first car, the Model A, retailed at $850 ($55,000) and immediately attracted sufficient demand to keep the workforce fully occupied. A year later the $800 Model C was produced. Despite the company’s apparent success, reflected in its ability to pay a 10% dividend after six months, Ford was again becoming dissatisfied. This time it was the range of models the company was committed to that vexed him. The Ford range included both low-cost, low-margin models and production vehicles which commanded much better margins and higher prices. The Model B car, for example, retailed at $1,000 (over $100,000). Wile there were many manufacturers at the high end of the market, Ford wished to focus on a vehicle that would sit at the most affordable segment of the market.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Malcomson continued to push Ford towards speed trials to maintain the company’s marketing position, including a speed trial across Lake St. Clair. The world land-speed record that Ford achieved, combined with the personal danger he exposed himself to, brought all the publicity that Malcomson had hoped for – and $365,000 ($22m) of sales were recorded in the month of June 1905. Unfortunately for Malcomson, the speed trial was the final straw for Ford and he resolved to control his own destiny. Malcomson wished for high-priced vehicles, Ford the opposite – a view succinctly summed up in the quote: “A car should not have any more cylinders than a cow has <span id="anchor_2445_111"></span>teats.”<a href="ch98.html#anchor_2775_0">⁵⁵</a> The battle over product strategy and control ended after an extended stormy period in 1906, with Malcomson selling his shares to Ford for $175,000 (over $10m).</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The success of the early models paved the way for the vehicle that became a historical landmark in the automobile industry: the Model T. Before the launch of the Model T in 1908, the industry had remained largely fragmented because of the large number of producers. Although the top producers still accounted for most of the output, their position at the ‘top’ was by no means a secure one despite efforts to force some degree of consolidation and hence stability. Two traditional methods had been employed in this regard. The first was the use of patent protection, the second the use of acquisition. The patent protection route involved the Electric Vehicle Company, which had found that while its vehicles were in secular decline, it did retain one valuable asset: the Selden patent.</span> </p>
