<title>Stock funding, De Forest style - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<div style="width:100%;height:14.375000000000002px;"></div>
<h1 id="anchor_2901_0"><span class="style1">Stock funding, De Forest style</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The De Forest Wireless Telegraph Company had been formed in 1902 with a share capitalisation of roughly £3m ($200m). This sizeable sum was sufficient to fund initial operations, but the real expansion came with a partnership between De Forest and Abraham White. De Forest had been unable to raise further capital, despite the positive news-flow from Marconi’s transatlantic publicity. White understood that public fascination more than compensated for professional scepticism and later in 1902 changed the company’s name to the American De Forest Wireless Telegraph Company. Initially the capital was raised to $5m and in 1904 it was tripled to $15m (nearly $1bn today). From the very outset it appeared that the principals were well aware that the business would be sustained by the sale of shares rather than the generation of revenue.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It was vital, therefore, that the company stayed at the forefront of the public’s mind. This was to be achieved by specific demonstrations to the public rather than by fundamental, research-driven advances. A frequently quoted note from De Forest’s diaries sums up rather forcefully part of the purpose:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“Soon, we believe, the suckers will begin to bite. Fine fishing weather, now that the oil-fields have played out. ‘Wireless’ is the bait to use at present. May we stock our string before the wind veers and the sucker shoals are swept out to <span id="anchor_2907_45"></span>sea.”<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3282_0">⁶⁴</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In order to whet the appetite of these ‘suckers’, White ensured that demonstrations were made wherever potential investors could be found. Since New York was vital, a penthouse laboratory was built in Manhattan, and with stock sales expected in Georgia a station was built in Atlanta.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Perhaps the most inspired publicity stunt came by combining the wireless with the automobile in 1903, when a car carrying a wireless station was parked in Wall Street. The list of publicity-generating events goes on, but particular use was made of press releases. The technique was to issue a press release or pass information to the press and, when it was reported (typically without any attempt at authentication), the company would then incorporate it into its advertisements for the sale of stock. Such episodes included a claim that the company had absorbed American Marconi and another that it had been appointed official supplier to the US <span id="anchor_2911_107"></span>Navy.<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3283_0">⁶⁵</a> If this was not powerful enough propaganda, reference to the success of the Bell Companies after initial disbelief was always available to help counter any scepticism.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Yet De Forest was not simply a manipulator. Although the genuine element of his research tended to come a distant second to the stock market operations, De Forest</span> <span class="style1">did</span> <span class="style0">build wireless systems. In the early years the majority of his work could at best be described as incremental and at worst as simply plagiarism. His approach was to investigate carefully whether there were any potential prior claims for patented work. If there were, he would copy and improve it. This was a path that inevitably led to litigation, but in the intervening period his company made large sales at low costs. In part, the large sales were stimulated by the fact that revenue was not the prime consideration for the company and as a consequence the prices that were charged could never lead to meaningful profits.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Using a combination of high press visibility and low-cost sales, De Forest was able to successfully paint a picture of his company as the market leader in America. In this he was assisted by the US Navy, which was perfectly willing to ignore patent infringement, and by the increasingly strident noises coming from Fessenden. De Forest was winning business from the Navy by underbidding NESCO by roughly 80%, which may explain why they were perfectly happy to ignore the patent infringement. Despite repeated judgements in Fessenden’s favour, it was not until 1906 that De Forest was eventually prevented from selling more infringing equipment. Indeed, sufficiently serious was the case that in order to avoid a warrant for his arrest issued in New York in April 1906, he was forced to leave the country. He remained in Canada until his stock market partner, Abraham White, could raise a $5,000 bond, whereupon he returned to find himself forced out of the company that bore his name. Anticipating the difficulties that the company was to face, White had formed a new company, United Wireless Telegraph, into which the assets of the previous company had been injected. The American De Forest Wireless Company was therefore left effectively as a shell, but one which bore the liabilities of Fessenden’s litigation. De Forest recognised the dangers of holding stock in this company and handed back his shares to avoid personal liability from its creditors. His next step was to seek employment from Fessenden, an offer that was not surprisingly refused. Thus spurned, he formed the De Forest Radio Telephone Company and shortly afterwards the Radio Telephone Company.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">So far as the United Wireless Company was concerned, it was effectively business as usual. Shares continued to be sold to the public and the company continued to grow its sales, albeit at an unprofitable rate subsidised by the cash raised from the repeated share sales. This mode of operation could only continue for so long as the public was willing to subscribe for shares without regard to the profitability of the company. Under investigation by the US government, and pressure from Marconi for patent infringement, it capitulated and sold itself to Marconi. Excerpts from a series of articles published in 1907 provide a fascinating insight into the practices of the time.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style1">The excitement surrounding the work of Marconi and the ease with which he was to raise funds in America had the effect of drawing the attention of numerous speculators. The series of articles published in</span> <span class="style0">Success Magazine</span> <span class="style1">by Frank Fayant in 1907 discussed the excess created by buoyant market conditions and focused on the radio in general, and the activities of De Forest’s associates in particular. The strategy of these promoters was relatively straightforward. The first step was to form a company with some apparent claim on radio technology and allocate shares among themselves. The second step was to raise public awareness and draw attention to the company and its apparent prospects. The third step was to then sell shares to the public at whatever share price could be generated, preferably a share price rising in steps to allow continuing interest and shares sales.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Accomplishing the step of company formation was a relatively simple. So far as acquiring an interest in radio technology was concerned, it was not necessary that either the patents or the staff be credible in a scientific or commercial sense, only that they could be promoted to the general public. Indeed, since Marconi himself came under fire from certain quarters, who could gainsay any alternative companies? The second step required publicity. Just as Marconi gained publicity from public demonstrations, so too did his stock market competitors. The De Forest companies were the most credible alternatives, but the difference was that they relatively quickly became vehicles the primary purpose of which was the raising of funds rather than the creation of a viable business.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The history begins with both De Forest’s original fundraising efforts and those of American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph. The latter, like most radio companies, was heavily promoted using the success of the Bell Companies as an example. One of the subsidiaries of American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph was Federal Wireless, which covered the eastern states. This company was heavily promoted by a Mr L. E. Pike, who had cut his teeth launching oil and mining companies when that was the particular vogue. Federal was quickly absorbed into Consolidated Wireless on a share-exchange basis. Consolidated then had a capital reduction before taking over International Wireless and itself being absorbed by the American De Forest Wireless Telegraph Company. The financial consequences of this convoluted chain of events was spelled out by Fayant:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“$50 (real money) bought $50 worth of Pike’s wireless, January, 1902</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">= $50 (certificate) watered Consolidated, February, 1902;</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">= $10 (certificate) unwatered Consolidated, October, 1902;</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">= $10 (certificate) International, February, 1903;</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">= $10 (certificate) American De Forest, January 1904;</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">= $7.50 (company’s money) subscription price of De Forest, St Louis office, October 1906;</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">= $6.00 (company’s money) subscription price of De Forest, New York office, October 1906;</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">= $0.85 (real money) cash market value.”</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The final three prices are explained by Fayant as follows:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“what these De Forest shares are now worth is something of a mystery. The De Forest home office is in St.Louis, and from this office notice was recently sent me that the price of the common stock has been advanced to $7.50. The manager of the New York office two weeks later denied that any De Forest stock was for sale at this price, and continued to offer it at $6. Meanwhile several brokers in New York and Philadelphia have been offering De Forest stock around eighty-five cents a share… Meanwhile, I am in receipt of this appeal from American De Forest promoters:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">‘There is not enough stock to go around. Consider the matter carefully. You have the opportunity. Will you grasp it “at the flood tide” (now) and ride on to the shore of plenty, high and dry above the adversities which often beset old age, to the land of our dreams, where the wealth is unbounded and every wish gratified, where comforts admit of enjoyment and wealth admit of opportunities for yourself and those you love? Or will you hesitate and doubt, and let the chance go by, to remain in senile dependency upon the bounty of others? Think! It is time for you to decide! Think well! Buy! Do it now!’</span> <span class="style1">”</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The statements of opportunity from American De Forest were little different from those that had accompanied its previous incarnations. Consider the extract below from the prospectus of the International Wireless Telegraph Company. Commercial reality rarely seemed to intrude in the marketing of promoters or the perceptions of investors:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style3">Prospectus of The INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS TELEGRAPH COMPANY</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style3">How Fortunes Have Been Acquired in Industrial Enterprises Embodying Uses of Electricity</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“Some few years ago the General Electric Company was capitalized at $33,000,000, and established factories for manufacturing electrical equipment. Its failure was predicted, its methods were openly derided and the stock for a considerable period was to be had at prices varying from $28 to $34 per share, the par value of which was $100. Within less than five years it has paid such handsome dividends that it has peaked at $270 per share, and predictions are frequently indulged in that it will exceed Standard Oil within a few years, or $850 per share.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“The history of the Bell Telephone stock is almost a household story. It went begging at first for chasers at 15 cents per share, and was sold at even less, and today that same stock is sold at $4,000 per share.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“There is no reason why International Wireless Telegraph Company’s stock will not share in even a more phenomenal increase; it has no necessity for erecting costly wire circuits, developing expensive conduits or purchasing franchises at an exorbitant figure. The public is eagerly awaiting a practical application, and it has only to manufacture its instruments, install its stations, and the message will flash to every quarter of the area controlled by its patents and franchises with even greater certainty than if sent by wire or cable, for no fallen trees can interrupt its business, no blizzard or flood undermine its avenues of communication, no careless lineman ground an entire circuit for miles, nor even the demonstrations of nature’s reserve force of electricity interfere with its operation, but make transmission of messages more certain than the best wire or cable system ever used. Therefore, is it not reasonable to suppose the future holds great possibilities in store for our stockholders? Within its immense expanse of territory are located millions of people whose only hope for cheaper telegraph and cable rates rests in a form of wireless communication, as the limit of economy in wire telegraphy has been reached for some time past, and therefore a large number of wireless stations will be bound to be equipped in the near future in their stead.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“Even at the rate of ten cents for ten words, as against the prevailing twenty-five cent rate, not only will the Company receive all of the existing telegraph and cable business between the stations which it may erect, but much new business will be created and obtained because of the cheaper cost.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“In wireless telegraphy a speed of twenty to thirty words per minute (without the use of codes) may be considered a fair average, although as high as forty-five words has been attained. At the average rate of thirty words per minute, at ten cents per ten words, one station working to its capacity for twenty-four hours would receive in gross earnings $432, but as at least one-half the words transmitted would consist of addresses and signatures, for which no charge would be made, a more correct estimate would be less than one-tenth this sum, say about $20 per station per day.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“Five hundred such stations would mean an average gross daily income of $10,000. A year’s work at these rates would mean a pretty income from operations alone. One of our licensed stations sent over 200 messages in one day. These figures, prodigious though they seem, we believe are really an underestimate of the true earning capacity of the Company after it is in full operation, because it has within its territory sufficient sites for probably ten times that number of stations. The claim is not made, however, that all of these would be worked to their full capacity, even in view of the great stimulation of telegraphic business following the cheaper rates, but we do believe that this company will have a dividend-earning power that will equal, if not exceed, that of any other industrial company.”</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Unfortunately, for investors, the above sequence of events was only the beginning of the fundraising exercises. The attractions of raising easy capital brought in more and more speculators. In the case of the De Forest companies the main actor was one Abraham White. White mutated the De Forest companies numerous times once he had obtained control. In each case similar tactics were used to achieve the same end: selling paper to the public. The common theme was use or manipulation of the press to promote his stock, whether by way of extravagant demonstrations, or through planted news stories or fictitious financial releases. Eventually, after the departure of De Forest, the company ended up as the United Wireless Company which was promoted as the vehicle under which the Marconi and De Forest systems would be brought together. Note that the Marconi Company was sufficiently concerned in the reporting of this scheme that it was forced to explicitly refer to it in its annual report, despite the fact that it had no foundation in truth.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">What were the implications for the investor? For the equity investor, the holder of the common stock, an exchange was being offered from the effectively worthless American De Forest Company into United Wireless. For the investor who took added security by investing in bonds rather than equity, the preferred status on assets and profits served little purpose since the exchange being offered was at an effective discount of 80%, and into equity not to instruments of similar credit rank. Moreover, all those who exchanged had to leave their new stock in an escrow account for two years. One would have imagined that such a diminution of value would have deterred investors from subscribing but the opposite was actually the case. Such was the optimism in the ‘new’ technology of the day that investors were willing to continue backing promises. The scheme was only ended when the main players were incarcerated and the company lost its litigation battle with American Marconi, at which point it was subsumed by its main commercial protagonist. Put otherwise, $50 invested in the wireless became 85 cents by 1907 and zero by 1911.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">7.2 – A fool and his money – a cautionary tale</span> </p>
<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style0">International Wireless Telegraph Company prospectus. Frank Fayant, ‘Fools and Their Money’,</span> <span class="style1">Success Magazine</span><span class="style0">, vol. 10, no. 155, April 1907.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">De Forest continued with his new Radio Telephone company and was able to bring to it an invention that subsequently became the bedrock of the radio. Like his other work, this invention could be seen as a revision of existing work, but it was deemed to be sufficiently different that in 1907 he gained a patent for the ‘audion’.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In Britain, John Ambrose Fleming had been working on improving reception and to this end had drawn on his previous experimental work as an adviser to the Edison companies. During that time he had worked with incandescent light and vacuum chambers. The result became known as the ‘Fleming valve’ and was patented in Britain in 1904 and the US in 1905. This valve brought with it the ability to receive the human voice. De Forest’s contribution was to add a third element that allowed the valve both to receive and amplify these signals. There has been a debate ever since about the extent to which scientist was influenced by the other, and who could claim to be the true inventor. From a commercial perspective, the important point was that both individuals were awarded patents for their work. The contradictions caused by both patents being issued were later to cause a stalemate in the use of these valves.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">De Forest was once more in a position to begin another stock marketing campaign. This time, though, it was based on a brand new concept, namely that the radio be used to broadcast to the general public in return for a licence fee. The field here was relatively open since Marconi and his main competitors remained focused on point-to-point signalling. Once more, headline-grabbing demonstrations were arranged accompanied by grandiose claims. In 1908 De Forest broadcast a message from the Eiffel Tower which was picked up at the coastal port of Marseilles nearly 600 miles away. The subsequent stock sales were successful, with De Forest and a sales team headed by James Dunlop Smith targeting potential investors. The company did not survive as long as his first vehicle, however. The capital raised was soon frittered away and by the end of 1909 it was bankrupt.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Undeterred, De Forest and one of his stock salesmen created another company, the North American Wireless Company, and set up another publicity-gathering performance. On this occasion it involved an attempt to broadcast a performance by operatic tenor Enrico Caruso from the Metropolitan Opera. The broadcast had limited success. More importantly, the excesses of previous stock promotion efforts had finally galvanised the government into action and brought the episode to a close, at least for the time being. Whatever the motivations of De Forest, he was one of the first to realise the potential of radio as a broadcasting medium. This would be significant in subsequent negotiations with AT&amp;T over his patents as he retained the rights to the audion for broadcasting purposes.</span> </p>
