<h1 id="anchor_3434_0"><span class="style1">The next wave of innovation</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The economic growth of the industrial world and the profits which accompanied it necessitated a different approach to business management. The requirements for large-scale manipulation and processing of financial and commercial information created a huge demand for mechanical means of simplifying and speeding up the process. Although electricity had entered the equation, it had done so only as an alternative method of powering the mechanical adding equipment. The constraints on expansion of this equipment were therefore based on the capabilities of precision engineering, just as they were in Babbage’s time. The main difference was that there was an eager and growing client base which extended well beyond government into the private sector.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the technological sense the need was to utilise the properties of electricity to replace mechanical components. Some of the skills and knowledge required already existed, although these were fairly disparate – spread as they were through a wide range of industries and being applied to related but different applications, from the technology of the radio and television through to power generation and lighting. Most important of all, though, was the role of the government and in particular the needs of the military.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The machines being manufactured and sold remained largely unchanged in their capabilities. They were effectively simple adding machines, albeit ones that could operate at increasing speeds and with ever larger volumes of information. Many companies sought to establish a foothold in the industry, drawn by its growth and the perceived profit potential, but it remained a relatively small business sector when compared with the steel, chemical and automobile industries. As a new business sector, it also competed for capital with the radio and television companies that by this time were beginning to understand the commercial potential of broadcasting, in addition to the point-to-point transfer of information. Moreover, other companies that had grown rapidly over the previous decades, such as AT&amp;T and GE, also found they could not ignore the potential in the area. New technological applications of electrical power, for example, demanded substantial mathematical modelling in order to predict the outcomes of various combinations of events. Such modelling could take two principal forms: analogue and digital. Analogue modelling at its simplest consisted of building abstract scale models, trying to mirror possible conditions, and from there attempting to extrapolate the likely results. Lord Kelvin (one of the technology giants of the 19th century) had, for example, built an analogue model to help predict tide patterns. The mechanism simulated the effect of the interaction of gravity to allow prediction of tide levels and therefore the plotting of tide charts for harbours. Similarly, when companies such as GE or Westinghouse installed new power networks, they had to work out the effect of linking up different systems. They used massive simulators to observe the range of potential outcomes. The common characteristic of these analogue models was that they were designed for a specific purpose and by definition had limited use.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Some analogue models were designed in such a manner that they could solve a particular</span> <span class="style1">classification</span> <span class="style0">of problem, but even these were limited in their general application. In addition, the accuracy of the analogue machines’ calculations was limited by the accuracy of the model, which in turn depended upon the precision of the machinery. It is a testament to the scientific knowledge and expertise which went into their construction that wave machines, for example, continued to be used well after World War II.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The main point is simply to distinguish these methods of analysis from their numerical or digital counterparts. Where numerical computing differed was that it required no physical representation of the problem being modelled. If the problem could be modelled mathematically, it could be solved numerically – assuming the resources were there to allow the necessary computation to take place. In the 1930s the process of computation remained largely manual, although rather than the tally sticks of the previous century, the ‘human computers’ made use of the new adding machines. Just as better organisation had improved efficiency for Napoleon a century before, so in the 1930s individuals such as Leslie Comrie in Britain revolutionised numerical analysis for astronomical work. The advances achieved by Comrie soon gave way to other uses, most notably ballistics.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Interest in computing power also spread geographically. Adding impetus to this spread were three factors. Firstly, office equipment companies were increasingly aware of the potential for extending the uses of adding machines and as such had ongoing research projects to this end. Secondly, the scientific community continued to seek practical solutions to produce working models that would provide them with the computational ability they needed to further their theoretical work. Finally, as the 1930s proceeded, the threat of war loomed ever larger, and governments increasingly turned to the business and scientific communities to provide assistance in the mathematically dependent fields of ballistics and code-breaking. In other words, there was a confluence of scientific interest and liberal funding from both the private and public sectors. Overlaid on top of this was national interest, which as had been shown with the radio during World War I, was an irresistible force for breaking down commercial secrecy and spreading information between hitherto separate groups.</span> </p>
