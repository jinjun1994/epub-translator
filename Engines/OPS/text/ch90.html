<h1 id="anchor_2383_0"><span class="style1">The Lead Cab Trust</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The promoters of electrical vehicles had not been blind to the uncertain outcome of the struggle between the different types of vehicles. The Electric Vehicle Company, the product of a combination of both vehicle and battery companies, had been backed by a group of Wall Street financiers with the purpose of establishing a fleet of electric taxi cabs in all major American cities. The so-called ‘Lead Cab Trust’ was not to enjoy a particularly happy or extended existence despite the fact that it raised substantial sums of capital. The scheme effectively worked as follows: corporate activity brought under one umbrella a number of companies involved in the manufacture and maintenance of electrical vehicles. These included the Columbia Automobile Company, the Electric Storage Battery Company, the New Haven Carriage Company and the US subsidiary of Siemens &amp; Halske.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">If one were to analyse the financial statements of the Electric Vehicle Company, at first sight the result would appear impressive as they shared the net profits of over $0.5m ($36m), dividends of $0.325m ($24m) and financial assets of $5m ($360m) in the shape of cash and marketable securities. In order to sell its vehicles the company had entered into agreements or set up operating companies which paid the Electric Vehicle Company for the privilege of the exclusive right to purchase and operate its electric vehicles. The financial results of the Electric Vehicle Company therefore largely reflected the sale of rights to these operating arms, either for cash or stock. The operating companies had raised capital from the public to finance their future operations. The profits of the Electric Vehicle Company were then simply the transfer of capital raised from the public. The financial results reflected only the successful capital-raising exercise and bore no relation to future operations.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style1">Horseless Age</span><span class="style0">, 24 January 1900.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Despite this the directors were perfectly comfortable paying out a large dividend. For the whole venture to succeed, the operating companies had to run profitably. Should this not happen the only winners would be the original promoters who had sold their stock or received sufficient dividends to more than repay its capital. For the promoters, what was important was that there was at least the illusion of operational success. The operating businesses could continue to run for so long as cash was available to fund the losses, and so long as it was running – and the public was receptive – the illusion of success could be maintained. The operations ultimately failed because of the vehicle’s short battery life and the resultant running costs of the operation. The venture was also tarnished by irregularities surrounding the use of $3m of funds ($220m), including a $2m loan said to have been authorised by an office boy. Moreover, the trade press was not uniformly supportive; articles were written which pointed out the illogicality of running uncompetitive businesses at a persistent loss for any reason other than stock manipulation. Despite this the company managed to achieve a market capitalisation of $20m in 1900 ($1.4bn) before it declined towards receivership seven years later. The underlying nature of many automobile ventures can be gauged from the reminiscences of Hiram Maxim, the head of production at the predecessor of Columbia Motors: “the scheme was a very broad one, promising all manner of possibilities in the way of stock manipulation. Whether it was intended to develop profits out of earned dividends, or by unloading stock on the public, I will not venture to guess. In those days of wild finance, unloading stock upon the public was very <span id="anchor_2394_291"></span>fashionable.”<a href="ch98.html#anchor_2774_0">⁵⁴</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It has to be assumed that many of the promoters exited with substantial profits during this period, and it was certainly the case that legal action followed over the payment of dividends. Whether this was much consolation to the public which lost its investments is another matter.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In 1899 the Electric Vehicle Company acquired from George Selden his American patent on the automobile. Selden had updated his patent as advances took place in Europe, and although he never produced an actual working car, his patent covered the major components of the internal combustion vehicle. Selden did not in any meaningful sense develop the automobile, but he was one of the first to recognise the potential significance of the European advances and take patent protection for them in America. The Electric Vehicle Company had purchased the Selden patents at the instigation of William Whitney, one of the prime promoters of the company. Whitney had enquired about patents “which might cause trouble”, though whether he meant trouble to him or his competitors is not entirely clear. For the rights to his patent, George Selden received $10,000 (nearly $0.75m) and 20% of any future royalties earned from it. The rights to future income received by the Electric Vehicle Company were to be important, given the failure of its operating ventures.</span> </p>

<h2><span class="style1">(c) The gasoline-powered vehicle</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The early manufacturers of the gasoline automobile came from the same background as their electric and steam contemporaries. They came out of the railroad industry (William Chrysler), the bicycle industry (Alexander Winton, the Duryea brothers), the electrical generation industry (Henry Ford), the electrical parts industry (James Packard), the machinery industry (Ransom Olds) and the horse-carriage industry (Studebaker). All the industries that were either related to, or threatened by, the automobile industry supplied the individuals who were to take the technological leadership from Europe. These names are well known today simply because they survived long enough to record a place in the history books, but in this they were a minority. While the industry was displaying rapid growth it also initially had relatively low barriers to entry.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the early years the companies that produced automobiles were more assemblers than they were manufacturers. The demand for automobiles verged on a craze, allowing sellers to achieve the best possible sales terms, typically cash on delivery, and often with upfront deposits of 20% or more. For the producers, once the design was completed and tested, the main task was the assembly of standardised parts from a variety of suppliers. Often the credit period from the suppliers was of the order of 30–90 days, and this combination of circumstances effectively allowed a negligible capital cost to the producer if the automobile could be assembled and sold within this period.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">With such market conditions it was natural that many new entrants were attracted to the industry. Between 1900 and 1908 nearly 500 automobile manufacturers entered the industry – and more than 250 exited. Within the same period, nearly 100 companies both entered and exited the industry in the same year. This should not be surprising; in the nascent automobile industry, the ability to enter was constrained principally by the question of credibility to the end customer, who could obviously have little experience of the product in question. The general credibility of the gasoline automobile had begun with reports from Europe, and had been enhanced by demonstrations and trials in America. In this regard two important landmarks were the 800-mile Cleveland to New York trips completed by Alexander Winton in 1897 and 1899, and the Detroit to New York trip completed by a curved-dash Oldsmobile four years later.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Both Alexander Winton and Ransom Olds saw big boosts to their sales due to the publicity generated by these trips. In other words, marketing was key in demonstrating to the potential client base that the car would work on a sustainable basis. This underlined the importance both of speed races and endurance trials in the battle to win the public mind. The exploits of Alexander Winton were extended when in 1903 one of his automobiles covered the journey from San Francisco to New York in 63 days. Not to be outdone, a Packard then rose to the challenge, covering the same route in ten days fewer.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Eventually more formalised versions came to the fore, with reliability trials sponsored by Charles Glidden and the Vanderbilt Challenge Cup. These endurance trials and speed races were now no longer items of ridicule, although there were concerns over their safety. By 1905 the gasoline engine automobile was firmly established, and while not all its steam and electric competitors had yet thrown in the towel, the growth rates of the gasoline version soon left the others as little more than niche bystanders. The question was not so much whether the gasoline car was the vehicle of choice; rather, what size the market would eventually become and the structure it would eventually take.</span> </p>
