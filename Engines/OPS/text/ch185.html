<title>Towards a brave new world - Engines That Move Markets</title>
</head>
<body>

<div style="width:100%;height:14.375000000000002px;"></div>
<h1 id="anchor_4800_0"><span class="style1">Towards a brave new world</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Through a boom-and-bust period, followed by one of sustained development, the Web and its accompanying infrastructure have reached a position of initial maturity. Notwithstanding pockets of under-penetration in more isolated areas, the developed world is now largely connected. Navigation and access to information is relatively straightforward and little technical expertise is required. At the time of writing the first edition of this book, the world was still in the midst of euphoria about the potential of this exciting new technology. The financial markets have since moved on to what is often called Web 2.0, the period that followed the TMT stock market collapse. Many of the companies that emerged during this phase were at least in gestation during the previous period, so it is important not to draw too great a distinction between the two periods.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The pace of change has been rapid. Although the Internet only began to register in the public consciousness some 25 years ago, the early years of the Web are becoming a distant memory for many. So-called ‘millennials’ struggle to recognise the environment that preceded the Web, when letters and the postal service were still a necessity and the clunky ‘fax’ machine was the most rapid form of transmission. Even email, the first ‘killer app’, has been to some extent superseded by social media. Despite the changes that have taken place and the apparent ubiquity of the Internet made possible by the rapid spread of mobile devices, the likelihood is that in terms of impact we may still be in the early stages of its development.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">To recap some of the themes discussed earlier: the shift to online advertising will continue, but more slowly, and at some stage the gorillas of the space, Google and Facebook, will find growth harder to achieve. Online retailing is now relatively mature and future growth is likely to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Similarly, delivery of digital media content is now widespread and no longer a new area. Participants will continue to turn their attention to creating new content. The biggest area of future disruption is likely to be in the financial sector. This is a sector which has grown to be cost-heavy and burdened by systems redundancy. In all likelihood new entrants will pick away at segments of bank services and be able to provide a higher-quality product at a lower cost. Given the competition between security and ease of use, this is a relatively slow-burn development, but it is highly likely to be a dominant investment theme in the coming years.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">Banks – where the money is</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As discussed earlier, the financial sector has taken an ever larger part of the national cake. Arguably this has been the product of bureaucratic structures, inertia and inefficiency rather than the result of innovation and a better customer experience. Digital disruption remains in its infancy in the financial sector and the time is ripe for this to change. Payment companies such as PayPal and Square have emerged and have so far largely operated as front ends for existing payment-processing systems, whether on PCs or (increasingly) for mobile devices. Further penetration into the payments system seems inevitable. Similarly, peer-to-peer lenders such as Funding Circle in the UK or Lending Club in the US are only the pioneers in what promises, by cutting out the middle man, to be a much more extensive raid on the traditional lending business of the banks. No doubt credit quality issues will hurt the new wave of lenders when economic conditions deteriorate, but this will pause rather than halt the underlying trend. It seems inevitable that in short order we will see many traditional banking functions migrate to handheld devices as new, nimble companies exploit the IT legacy issues all incumbent banks face. The emergence of blockchain technology, the system of interconnected ledgers that underpins bitcoin and other forms of digital money, also has the potential to revolutionise the cost structure of the banking industry.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Money is by far the largest digital product in the economy, so the scope for Internet-driven disruption in the financial services business is considerable. It promises to produce the kind of efficiency gains that long-suffering bank customers have waited in vain to experience for years. The importance of the financial sector to the global economy was emphasised by the global financial crisis, which brought with it both a renewed focus on the regulatory regime and a concern over the ‘too big to fail’ aspect of many participants. Given the operating practices that were revealed in the wake of the crisis, it would be hard to argue that trust in banks is widespread. All these factors make finance highly susceptible to the disruptive forces and efficiency gains that we have already seen at work in other industries. It may well be, in fact, that the global financial crisis will turn out to be a landmark turning point for the structure of the financial sector.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">To take one topical example: recent years have seen the rise of cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency is a virtual digital asset used as a means of exchange. It is similar to existing fiat currencies in that it depends upon trust. The difference is that fiat currencies rely on trust in issuing governments whereas cryptocurrencies rely on trust in the backing blockchain accounting system – the exchanges, the ‘wallets’ that hold the currency, and the process of new issuance (‘mining’). Blockchain provides proof of ownership, the wallets provide storage, and mining controls the effective money supply. Cryptocurrencies are largely unregulated and unmonitored. It is indicative of the lack of general trust in the conventional banking system that bitcoin, the primary cryptocurrency, has achieved such prominence. Despite the negative headlines associated with the collapse of exchanges such as Mt. Gox and the use of cryptocurrencies to facilitate drug trafficking, by 2017 the price of bitcoin was soaring as speculators jumped on the bandwagon. One did not need to speculate on the future viability of cryptocurrency and other non-traditional means of exchange to know how this would end. Nor is it difficult to envisage the level of regulatory discomfort with a parallel currency system operating outside government control. However, this should not lead one to dismiss the potential use of the technology involved or assume that cryptocurrencies have no future at all.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">Platforms and networks: the holy grail</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Where there are few intrinsic barriers to entry, the ability of companies to sustain profitability depends upon the traditional parameters of economies of scale or intellectual property. The holy grail of scale is to become a successful ‘platform’ which other suppliers need so badly that you are seen as indispensable. On mobile, Apple has created an ecosystem – iTunes and the App Store – which should allow premium pricing to be sustained. Android has successfully protected Google’s market share during the transition to mobile. By contrast Nokia, which once had the dominant (circa 40%) position in mobile handsets, was relegated to a footnote in history with its eventual purchase and closure by Microsoft.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There is an important lesson here for investors. When hardware becomes commoditised and software becomes the differentiator, hardware firms find it very difficult to make the transition, partly for cultural reasons and partly because of the embedded handicap of their prior history. In the case of Nokia, the company was dominated by skilled engineers and scientists. In a world where this was key, Nokia prospered. However, when the user interface took over as the critical factor, it played directly into Apple’s hands. Because of its historic hardware culture and its dated system architecture, Nokia was persistently playing catch-up to the point that it ceased to be relevant in an industry it had dominated only a few years previously. It is a repeating theme for investors to remain wary when industry leaders built on hardware expertise come under attack from software entrants. The cultures are very different and the rule-based incumbents struggle to encompass the more anarchic form of software developers, particularly when playing catch-up.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">Content is king</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The increasing bandwidth available to users means that digital distribution of content has become ubiquitous. Streaming businesses such as Spotify (for music) and Netflix (for films) have quickly made clunkier CDs and DVDs redundant. No longer do the constraints imposed by physical delivery apply. Historically distribution was constrained by shelf space. If consumers wanted something different from the broadcast schedule they had to visit their local video store and rent a DVD. The catalogue available to them was constrained by the shelf space of the store in question. The same applied to the purchase of music. Consumer preferences were only revealed within these constraints. Digitisation, compression and distribution have created almost unlimited choice by removing these constraints. What has become immediately apparent is that consumer tastes are much more eclectic and varied than was hitherto supposed. As a consequence back catalogues of content have retained a much higher value than anticipated. This phenomenon was characterised as ‘the long tail’ by the editor of</span> <span class="style1">Wired</span> <span class="style0">magazine, Chris Anderson. The implications are profound and extend beyond simply music and video. The ‘long tail’ does not suggest that there will no longer be ‘hits’. It rather illustrates that there are deep and valuable niches in consumer preferences which have previously been difficult to identify and access. These niches are now accessible and hence monetisable.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Critically, despite the technology expertise embedded in the creation of the distribution channels, the regulatory framework ensures that it is content or control of content that is accruing the returns. To the traditional forms of entertainment must be added an industry which has moved on from its early individual console days to take a whole new form. Improvements in processing power, memory and communications have revolutionised an electronic gaming industry where not only are the numbers of users growing exponentially, but such is its popularity that it has become a spectator sport to rival soccer and athletics tournaments. Electronic gaming has become a significant component of the quoted technology sector.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This is not to say that all content is helpful. To the extent that content drives usage and hence derives data, there is no incentive for any site to pay attention to the veracity of that content. Unburdened by the restrictions placed on the published press, there is a real danger that a network of unsubstantiated rumour is created which could undermine legitimate sources of news. The unfolding scandals relating to the 2016 US presidential election are only just one example of this. Currently, the label ‘fake news’ seems to be applied to any news that does not suit a particular agenda rather than to that which has no empirical or factual underpinning. To that extent it has ironically undermined the term itself. However, fake news does exist and eventually one would expect the driving out of legitimate news by fake news will reverse as the population tires of such sources and gravitates back to sites and copy underpinned by genuine research and analysis. Perhaps the 2013 purchase of the</span> <span class="style1">Washington Post</span> <span class="style0">by Jeff Bezos rather, than as some perceived it, being a vanity project, was simply another example of his prescience. The newsprint advertising model was destroyed by the Internet, leaving high-quality journalistic content on the verge of bankruptcy. Such content languishing at low cost can be snapped up and embedded in the new distribution and information model that the Internet created. Given his track record it should not come as a surprise if Bezos yet again proves to be the one who understood best the opportunities being created.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">More efficient asset utilisation</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The advent of the Internet has encouraged better price discovery to the benefit of consumers, and with it the ability to create efficiently functioning marketplaces in the utilisation of large assets. For consumers the two most obvious underutilised assets they own are their homes and their cars. For homes, Airbnb – a network that enables homeowners to offer paying customers a direct way to rent rooms or whole properties – is probably the best-known new entrant, but there are many other competitors emerging in this space. With cars, Uber has the greatest visibility, but there are many other direct competitors and taxi-hailing applications. The one outcome that can be predicted with a degree of confidence is that assets will be better utilised in the future than they have been in the past.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">Look out: regulators and the taxman on the case</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Where business are naturally monopolistic there will always be a tendency over time to use barriers to entry to create monopoly profits and potentially indulge in the type of behaviour that inevitably attracts the attention of regulators. Just as U.S. Steel, the railroads and Standard Oil became the targets of antitrust action, so too will the platforms that evolve into natural monopolies. It is not just anti-competitive behaviour that will attract scrutiny. The sensitive nature of the personal and commercial information collated by Internet-based companies marks them as permanent targets for hackers ranging from hobbyists to criminals and foreign intelligence agencies. Cyber security requirements can therefore only grow over time as criminals find digital crime to be more efficient than traditional methods. Identity theft and misrepresentation are the keys to fraud and the Internet lexicon is already replete with terms such as ‘spear phishing’, ‘clone phishing’ and ‘whaling’, which describe the attempts to open the doors to illegally accessing funds. It is highly likely that regulators will impose more stringent duties of care on the confidentiality and protection of personal data. The antitrust aspect of this relates to the role of the Internet in removing consumer and producer surplus, i.e. the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay and where producers would be willing to sell and where they actually sell. Price-comparison sites remove producer surplus to the extent that consumers are able to access this knowledge. Hitherto this has been the dominant influence but as greater information on the customer accumulates it can be used to inform the seller as to the price the customer might be willing to pay and to price accordingly. Whether it be Uber pricing higher during peak periods, or websites that differentially price according to the characteristics of the user, there is the clear potential for discriminatory pricing. No regulator would wish to act where prices are being lowered, but where personal information is being used to create ‘artificially’ higher pricing then it is not hard to see regulatory action following, particularly if the supplier of this information had some form of monopoly access to the data.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Government involvement in commerce has not been restricted to regulation of markets. Military requirements have typically been the most significant drivers of scientific development. From ancient times the first responsibility of government has been to protect its citizens. This has underpinned expenditure on defence from ballistics to the Internet. Paying for defence by raising taxes has been the natural counterpart. The Internet was the child of the Cold War and in its early stages the focus was on its physical deployment, efficiency and bandwidth. While development of these areas has continued, the focus of commercial development has shifted to applications and software. A by-product of this has been the ability to utilise transfer pricing to reduce effective tax rates in a way that was rarely possible before.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Under current accounting rules, set against the backdrop of competing tax regimes, companies now effectively have freedom to ascribe profits to the geographic jurisdiction of their choice. Revenues may be generated in one country but costs can be allocated to another as payments for intellectual property, such that profits are transferred from a higher-tax regime to a lower one. Companies legitimately argue that they are only following the guidance of the relevant tax codes and have done nothing illegal. Individual governments counter with the view that this is all smoke and mirrors. In the ‘national interest’, companies should pay a ‘fair’ share of taxes relative to revenues generated within their borders. The logical conclusion is that if redress under the current tax rules proves unsuccessful, the rules will have to be changed. This process is already evident in the European Union, with cases pending against Apple, Amazon and Google. For some it is an example of economic nationalism. This is certainly how the companies involved will wish it to be viewed. The underlying cause is that a tax regime created for companies in an era of physical assets and products is proving less than optimal in a digital one. It is slightly ironic that the infrastructure of the Internet was created by one arm of government but has given rise to consequences that require the intervention of another.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">The divorce of ownership and control</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the early stages of the Internet, new software businesses tended to have relatively light capital requirements. The core element was the intellectual capital of the founders, often still operating in an academic or near-academic environment, and because of their cerebral nature frequently characterised as ‘geeks’. Future development involving commercial viability or maintaining market leadership required more substantive amounts of capital and was the cue for private investors and venture capitalists to enter. As in other technology cycles, companies that lacked continued access to capital or could not reach self-sustaining cash flow fast enough risked seeing their market positions swiftly competed away. The first-mover advantage that so exercised the early pioneers frequently proved to be a mirage. When funding dried up after the TMT crash, it was not first-entrant status that mattered, but who had the resources to survive and become the ‘last man standing’. The current era of freely available low-cost debt will not last indefinitely and it is not a wild guess to assume that when the cycle eventually reverses the Darwinian experience of the TMT crash will repeat itself.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For those who have been able to navigate the boom-and-bust cycle successfully, the rewards have been phenomenal. We have seen the emergence of a new generation of exceptionally wealthy and powerful individuals to rival the robber barons of the late 19th century. For Vanderbilt, Bell, Rockefeller and Ford, read Bezos, Brin/Page and Zuckerberg. Over time it is a safe bet that these new ‘titans’ will attract both the praise and opprobrium that their predecessors historically attracted.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">What is remarkable is that in their desire to participate in the success of these new companies, institutional investors have been willing to jettison standard corporate governance principles, including accepting classes of shares that enable the founders to retain unequal voting rights. The original owners argue that their track record justifies such voting structures and (more convincingly) that investors were not forced to invest. Even where management has produced outstanding performance, the question for the future is whether these structures will stand the test of time as the stewards of the company change. History suggests that there are very few companies with a commercial track record so exceptional that the investor should be willing to indefinitely surrender voting control. Indeed there are clear examples of companies where warning signs are emerging on the need for vigilance on corporate governance matters and management accountability. The owners of a business have a duty to hold management to account for their stewardship and this duty should only be abrogated in very exceptional circumstances – and certainly not because of a desire to participate in shorter-term share-price movements.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">New professions</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The explosion in data created by the Internet and the low cost of storage has commercial value only if it can be properly analysed. The market has responded to this need by developing a variety of techniques, ranging from traditional statistical and econometric methods to tools such as artificial intelligence. Although this has been ongoing for some time, we are only at the rudimentary stage. Advertising and retailing have been the most affected so far. Next on the agenda will be financial services, health and the professions. Looking for patterns in data has a long-established history, primarily driven by the needs of military intelligence, which includes the remarkable achievements of the cryptographers under Alan Turing at Bletchley Park during World War II.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">These techniques will be used in a much more ubiquitous manner to allow the identification of data patterns. The combination of algorithm development and ever more specific processors to improve the efficiency of searches will allow much more rapid analysis of data patterns which hitherto were difficult to discern. In healthcare, the history of medical knowledge can be assimilated and over time artificial intelligence techniques will create decision rules that both enhance diagnosis and lead to new preventive discoveries. To give another example, much of the legal profession is based on the understanding of historic precedent and existing case law. This is exactly the type of analysis at which AI excels. Once a computer can find and rank all relevant cases, the role of the lawyer who once did that job inevitably changes. As taxi drivers in London have discovered, the painstaking process of acquiring ‘the knowledge’ (passing a rigorous test about the roads of the city) no longer protects their income when an Uber driver can use a smartphone to fulfil exactly the same function. In none of these cases does the technology make professionals redundant, but it does potentially remove a large slice of the costs that underpin their current earnings. If any of this feels familiar it is because it is uncannily close to the vision set out by Vannevar Bush in 1945. Over 70 years on, we appear to have reached a point where the critical elements are in place. Processing power, cloud storage and the World Wide Web together provide the tools that allow analytical techniques such as AI to make some of Bush’s vision reality.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As with all new exciting areas, ‘big data’ has frequently been overhyped in terms of the immediacy of its scale and impact. In itself data is an amorphous mass. The data has to be cleaned, put in a form where it can be interrogated and the results then interpreted. The whole process is riven with value judgements and is some distance from the dry abstract process many imagine. Moreover, there are many different elements and skill sets required – from those skilled in writing superfast algorithms to database experts and neural network specialists. This is an area that looks set for exponential growth.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">So, although it may be smaller in an economic sense than the potential disruption to the financial sector, disruption to the professions from these new factors could be equally meaningful. For those seeking to encroach on the tasks performed by the professions there will be the barrier presented by their professional bodies and their legally protected positions. The insurgents will view this as one of the last bastions of restrictive practices. There will undoubtedly be huge tensions between the goals of preserving quality of service and trust and the ability to reduce costs. Almost certainly the threat to traditional firms will come from within, as competitors try to usurp the historic dominance of the current market leaders.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">Darwin targets the slothful and unwary</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">When timeshare computing was first envisaged, it was seen as a solution to the prohibitive cost of processing power. When those costs started their rapid decline, it produced a new business environment in which processing power and storage were no longer regarded as of primary importance. Since then the world has moved on again, and improvements in communication (both in bandwidth and access) have produced another new dynamic. Although the term ‘cloud computing’ has a warmer feel to it than timeshare computing, it is nevertheless driven by the same economics. The sellers of cloud-based services can point to many benefits: flexibility over scale, more robust disaster recovery, lower hardware costs, lower maintenance costs and greater security once data is held centrally. So long as there is access to communications, the workplace can be replicated in another location at relatively low cost.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">If scale is no longer as important, then disintermediation will be a constant theme. The implications of this are potentially profound. The Darwinian process of evolutionary change may soon be challenging targets which hitherto have been perceived as untouchable. Existing businesses already have many redundancy and legacy issues to deal with in information technology. They will also find it difficult to embrace the benefits that the cloud and modern programming languages provide. There is no question that for many businesses the primary interface with customers will be a mobile device rather than a physical location. Companies unable to adapt to this world will be in serious trouble. For investors one of the key areas of investigation, where such change is endemic, will be whether established companies face institutional and structural barriers that threaten their ability to survive.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The one certainty is that, as with previous technology bubbles, the continued development of the Internet and the Darwinian forces that it has unleashed will take many industries and professions in new directions.</span> </p>
