<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">Standard Oil Trust</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Analysing Standard Oil is not any easy task. As a private company, financial statements are not readily available and it is necessary to rely a great deal on secondary sources. Given the circumstances of the time, and the enmity towards trusts such as Standard Oil, it is not surprising that the company did not freely disclose information. The information which did reach the public domain did so mainly as a result of government investigations and lawsuits. Share price information has to be taken from records of private trades, as there was no openly traded market in Standard Oil shares. Despite all these caveats it is relatively straightforward to draw some conclusions.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The most striking feature of Standard Oil is its balance sheet and the absence of either debt or interest-bearing securities that rank above equity. The expansion of the company was entirely self-financed, even if the divided payout ratio had gradually declined from roughly half earnings to around one third. The company typically released asset figures that netted off payables and receivables, which has the effect of reducing the figures for total gross assets (and liabilities). The assets figures shown in the chart have been adjusted for this and are the basis for the calculation of return on assets. The income figure used the company’s net earnings figure. It is not possible to calculate operating or net income margins due to the absence of information, but the indications are that the company charged excess depreciation against its revenues in order to deflate the earnings number. The depreciation charge was between 6% and 10% of assets and was at least three times that charged by competitors such as Unocal (2%). Inflating the depreciation charge reduced declared profit but had no impact on cash. For a company under pressure from the legislative arm of government, it would have made perfect sense to minimise the profit figures.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Within these headline figures, it can be seen that as the business grew the return on capital gradually fell from an exceptional 15–20% range towards 10%. This remained an extremely high return on assets, given the size of the company and the much lower returns being earned by its competitors and the best companies in other industries. The strong cash flow generation meant that expansion was largely self-funded, meaning that there was no need to take recourse to shareholders for additional capital. The lack of dilution ensured that the return on equity was enormous and grew. Although this is not revealed directly in the return on equity figures, which include retained profits, it would have been apparent from the buildup in shareholders’ funds per share, or book value per share. Shareholders therefore benefited from both a high dividend yield and the lack of dilution. While Standard Oil may not have been a monopoly in the strictest sense, as it had serious competitors, the returns on its business show that it enjoyed a considerable amount of pricing control. It was not immune from market conditions. Earnings did fluctuate from year to year and were sensitive to economic conditions to some extent. The report by Commissioner Garfield demonstrated the pricing power enjoyed by Standard Oil and its ability to cross-subsidise predatory pricing in the more competitive markets, most notably those outside the US.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The limited share price data available reflects the structure of ownership rather than the true value of the company. In the early 1900s the company had a total market capitalisation of $400,000–$600,000 (around $35bn), which was roughly equivalent to the accounting asset value of the company. The implied price-earnings multiple was between eight and ten times the following year’s earnings. The price at which private trades took place in the stock implied a secure dividend yield of 7%. Earnings growth was in the high single-digit range. While competition was increasing, the automobile was clearly set to become a huge source of demand in the future. For the 6,000 shareholders in Standard Oil, the true value of the shares would have been at least double or triple the price recorded in private trades. When the breakup of the company took place, the diminution of control over market conditions was relatively slight. One lesson for the future is that the enforced breakup of restrictive monopolies may not necessarily be bad for shareholders or the economy. A century on, the sensitivities of the investigation clearly linger. At least one company which was formerly part of the Standard Oil Trust refused to disclose the financial statements from the period leading up to the break up. No other company covered in this book did so!</span> </p>
