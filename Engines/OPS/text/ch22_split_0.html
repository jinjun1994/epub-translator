<h1 id="anchor_705_0"><span class="style1">How the boom ended</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The boom in railway shares continued into the second half of the 1840s before it finally ran out of steam. The eventual decline was the result of four factors. All four are typical of those that help to bring periods of financial excess to a close. First, as a large number of the shares were partly paid, many investors found they were overgeared and unable to make further payments without selling some of their holdings, which put further downward pressure on the price. Secondly, the financial projections with which many companies had raised money proved wildly over-optimistic – critically, they neglected to take account of the increasingly competitive nature of the business. Thirdly, the environment of speculative euphoria encouraged a fair amount of fraud and business practices that later did not stand up to scrutiny.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Finally, the economic and interest rate environment began to change. In October 1845, the Bank of England raised interest rates from 2.5% to 3%, and interest rates continued to rise thereafter. In 1846 the Irish potato crop failed and imports of foodstuffs soared. The outflow of bullion to pay for these imports forced interest rates higher and further contributed to the loss of liquidity. At the same time, deteriorating economics coincided with the outbreak of the revolutions of 1848 across Europe, raising the spectre of political instability. The impact of the rise in interest rates can be clearly seen in figure 1.4. Almost without exception, all periods of speculative excess in financial markets are assisted by easy money and brought to an end when interest rates start to rise once more.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The first sign that the boom was coming to an end for railway investors was the disappearance of substantial premiums on scrip issues for new companies. Share prices of existing railway companies began to fall: only the companies perceived as higher quality managed to maintain their share prices. The companies themselves called for more cash payments from investors as the lines they were building repeatedly failed to come in under budget. This should have come as no surprise. Even the best railways underestimated the cost of construction. For example, the Birmingham to London line, built in the 1830s, cost more than twice the estimates in its initial prospectus.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Despite this, many companies continued to maintain substantial dividend payouts. Even in the 1840s, when building was at its peak and competition was increasing, the bigger companies managed to maintain a dividend at anywhere between two and four times the prevailing market rate of interest. The subsequent rise in interest rates exposed the fact that many companies had effectively been paying dividends out of capital, a process that could not be sustained indefinitely.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">However, as Hudson had demonstrated, investor confidence – liberally watered with dividends – was the key to continued success. Investors who ignored the evidence of declining profitability and accounting fraud were to find that as interest rates rose, even companies whose profits actually covered their dividend payments could no longer sustain their level of payout. Figure 1.5 shows the drastic fall in the dividends of the leading railway companies at a time when interest rates were rising sharply. Suddenly the gloss had been removed from railway shares. Investors found themselves with scrip shares where payments were being demanded and where they had no cash to fulfil them.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The adulation which had previously been given to Hudson quickly turned to vilification. Hudson was exposed as a crook, who had produced fraudulent accounts to bolster profitability and had allowed dividends to be paid out of capital. Other transgressions, which enabled him to profit from private transactions at the expense of his companies, also surfaced in the public domain. Hudson’s fall from grace was swift, although in hindsight it can be clearly seen that he was as much a scapegoat as the villain of the piece. Although he was undoubtedly guilty of offences, they were relatively minor. His greatest offence was probably to perpetuate the myth of effortless profitability, a myth that the investing public was all too desperate to hear and believe. Faced with this unhappy situation, the British Government was forced to pass another parliamentary act to allow the railway industry to consolidate. Nearly 20% of the track authorised for construction was abandoned. The industry witnessed a series of mergers and combinations as the remaining companies sought to rebuild their profitability.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The sharp reversal in the stock market fortunes of the railway companies was reflected in the press coverage of the time. Hudson quickly moved from being an icon to a figure of ridicule. The role of the press during the railway mania closely anticipated that which was experienced with the Internet bubble. On the one hand, the quality press of the day provided sober assessments of the excesses and their likely consequences. In April 1845, for example, the</span> <span class="style1">Economist</span> <span class="style0">correctly forecast the way that the boom would end (figure 1.6). At the same time, the speculative boom prompted the emergence of a wave of new specialist journals which were in effect dedicated not just to reporting on but also promoting the new railway technology. They tended towards wild optimism about the stock market prospects of the industry.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This was an early example of a pattern that is still being repeated. New technology always creates a surge in journals catering for those fascinated by the lure of the new. The number of new journals and their longevity tends to mirror the movement in stock markets and provides a useful barometer of optimism. The mainstream press tends not to get carried away to the same degree. During the UK railway boom, they frequently cautioned, in increasing tones of incredulity, the scale of the potential that was apparently being discounted by current share price valuations. The scepticism was also reflected in satirical publications such as</span> <span class="style1">Punch</span><span class="style0">, both before and after the bubble.</span> </p>
