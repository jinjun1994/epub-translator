<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the early stages, the marketing department of Intel was correct. The principal use of microprocessing chips lay in the increasingly competitive calculator market. The Japanese companies Busicom, Sharp, Casio and Canon all manufactured or assembled calculators in association with US companies, such as Intel, Rockwell and Texas Instruments. They were joined by North American companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Commodore, Bowmar Instruments, and the Micro Instrumentation Telemetry Systems Company (MITS). Some of the microprocessor manufacturers, such as TI, also produced their own models directly. In Europe, a slide-rule manufacturer – Aristo, Dennert and Pape – sought to protect its 100-year-old heritage by joining the handheld calculator market decimating its traditional business. Its first calculator was based on a TI chip and retailed at DM480 ($200 or over $600 now).</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Demand in the early years was high; Hewlett-Packard found that its first scientific calculator, the HP-35, could retail at $395 ($1,500) and still result in a four-to-five-month order backlog. The price might have reduced from the equivalent of a family car, but it remained roughly 10% of the annual income of a skilled employee. The early chips held an equivalent processing power to the massive ENIAC machine completed barely a quarter of a century before. The demand quickly brought in new competitors and the calculator market became a ferociously competitive one as advances in chip design allowed manufacturers to lower their prices repeatedly.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style0">G. Ball and B. Flamm,</span> <span class="style1">The Complete Collector’s Guide to Pocket Calculators</span><span class="style0">, California: Wilson/Barnett Publishing, 1997.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It was not from technology advances alone that the problems stemmed. The chip manufacturers realised that the companies selling the calculators were making profits from a product which, in reality, was simply their chip in a small plastic wrapping. Not surprisingly, some manufacturers decided to try and take this profit for themselves by producing their own product, backed up with aggressive pricing. In a market where volume production was so important, casualties were unavoidable. The initial feast had simply brought too many hungry suppliers. The price of a scientific calculator was to halve three times in less than three years, from nearly $400 in 1971 to $200, then to $100 and in 1974 to under $50. MITS found itself trying to sell a self-assembly kit for $99 against an equivalent assembled product selling at less than half the price. The financial consequences were inevitable.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">So far as MITS was concerned, an alternative product had to be found if the company was to remain solvent. Ed Roberts, the president of the company, decided that there was no future in calculators and sought to find other uses for the Intel chips that had formed the guts of his calculator business. The target was to build a new product, differentiated from what already existed, where there would be, at least for a period, a degree of market protection and better profitability. Rogers rejected the earlier Intel chip designs as unable to provide the capability he required. When Intel produced the 8080 chip, however, it appeared to have overcome the problems of execution speed associated with its predecessors, and thus had the potential to become more than just a programmable calculator. Out of the near extinction caused by the oversupply of chips and the calculator price wars was to emerge a product of intensely more lasting significance. This was the personal computer.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The big computer manufacturers had a number of things in common. Firstly, most of them had the capability to produce a personal computer. Secondly, most of them also had within their organisation at least one champion of such a machine. In many cases, that proponent had produced either plans for a small computer or a rudimentary working model. At Hewlett-Packard, a design by a young engineer named Stephen Wozniak was rejected, not because of concerns over its feasibility but because the potential market was not immediately apparent. Equally, at Digital Equipment, David Ahl, the former head of the educational products division, put forward a proposal to develop a machine which could be sold to schools and other educational users. A prototype was developed but foundered due to lack of support from senior management.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Again one of the main obstacles was how support for such a machine could be supplied economically. Large companies or public organisations had their own internal support groups which could program and operate the computers. Small ones did not and companies such as DEC, HP, IBM and Control Data could see little possibility of a viable business model being developed. Early development of the PC did not therefore take place at the organisations best placed to move it onto a commercial footing. Rather, it was left to enthusiasts to develop their hobby into a viable business. In this, there were many similarities with the development of the radio, where for periods the amateur enthusiasts effectively sustained the non-military side of the business.</span> </p>
