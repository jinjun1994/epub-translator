<h1 id="anchor_653_0"><span class="style1">Success not guaranteed</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Initially, the success of the railway was through its industrial lines, particularly those linking coal-producing areas to existing transport links – or directly to end users. Transporting people was only a small proportion of traffic in the early years. Partly this was due to the very real threat of crashes, boiler explosions and fire from the gas lighting. (That said, these dangers were often exaggerated – particularly compared with the dangers of other available forms of transport.) There were some notable public relations setbacks; a spectacular example occurred during the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, when the ceremony was marred by the locomotive causing the death of a former cabinet minister.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">However, despite early problems with safety, the advance of the railways proved inexorable. The simple economics of their ability to shift large volumes of both passengers and freight at speeds much faster than horse-drawn coach traffic, and much more cheaply than canals, made their expansion assured. Although coastal steamboats competed vigorously for passenger traffic, they were unable to keep pace with the railways’ improvements in speed and efficiency.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">While the economic power of the railways was obvious, and the technology quickly proven, the introduction of railways in Britain was not a simple or smooth process. Like canals before them, land had to be purchased and existing buildings cleared to allow tracks to be laid between existing urban centres. Compulsory purchase of land has always raised public hackles, and the early locomotives were noisy and dangerous. At the same time, the vested interests of the canals were fighting a rearguard action.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It is ironic, then, that the first railways were built as feeder lines for the canal system. The Stockton and Darlington Railway was the first railway to use steam locomotion, but it was not set up as a direct competitor to existing canals. The first railway set up to compete directly with a canal was the Liverpool and Manchester in 1826. The same risk-seeking investors who funded the speculative bubble in South American mining ventures in 1824–25 also helped to provide capital for the new railways. In 1825–26, nearly as many railways were launched as had been brought into existence in the entire preceding 20 years.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">An initial surge of new railway companies in the mid-1820s was followed over the next decade by a steady stream of new issues. With capital plentiful, for a time the problem was not one of funding but – as with the Internet bubble – of finding enough new companies for investors to put their money into. In 1836–37, with stock markets buoyant and railway share prices having doubled, 44 new companies were authorised by Parliament. These 44 companies raised more money in this one period than had been raised in total by the industry up to that point.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the event, the enthusiasm was premature and in the years that followed, the index of railway share prices fell back. It was not until the early 1840s that it began to rise again and approach its previous peak. Between 1843 and 1845, the index of railway share prices doubled. Before 1843, the average annual investment in new railways, as represented by increases in authorised capital, was roughly £4m (the equivalent of $3bn today). In 1844 it was £20m, in 1845 nearly £60m and in 1846 it was £132m ($95bn). In 1846, a record 4,538 miles of new track was authorised.</span> </p>
