<p><span class="style0">The automobile transformed the transport business in the 20th century as profoundly and as dramatically as the railways had transformed economics and society in the 19th century. The story of the development of the automobile is a story of two great issues. The first concerned which of three rival technologies would emerge as the source of power for self-propelled vehicles. Although the petrol-powered internal combustion engine would ultimately emerge as the winner in this race, seeing off the challenge of steam and electric power in the process, the issue took several years to be resolved. The second issue was which of the hundreds of companies that set out to make and sell cars would succeed in establishing long-term viable businesses. A third, more tangential, issue was whether leadership in the automobile industry would be seized by the United States or by Europe. Investors at the time had to weigh up all three of these issues.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Although the 19th century was dominated by the growth and impact of the railways, it did not revolutionise every aspect of transportation. In America short journeys continued to be the province of horse-powered vehicles – carriages, single horses, or vehicles mounted on rails and pulled by horses. The huge volume of capital devoted to developing the railroads left little over for roads, so a dual system developed – railroads for long distances or heavy goods, and horses for shorter journeys. In Europe, where distances between urban populations and markets were not so great, railways and roads had developed alongside each other thoughout the 19th century to accommodate increased traffic.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The steam engine was the technology that powered the railways, but it stubbornly failed to provide what many hoped it would – namely a means of locomotion for a freestanding vehicle, one that was not bound by the constraints of rail tracks. Steam power was just one of the many alternatives explored in the search for the self-powered vehicle, or ‘horseless carriage’. Vehicles were constructed that utilised fuels such as gas, turpentine and alcohol. With gas, the principal issue was the volume required to allow any vehicle to travel a meaningful distance. Early signs were encouraging; with the development of coal gas, a fuel looked to be available which would provide an alternative to steam. The volume-versus-power problem had not, though, been resolved. For this reason the early success of a gas-powered engine, designed and patented in France by the Belgian, Jean-Joseph Lenoir, in 1860, proved illusory – despite press plaudits at the time. Alcohol and turpentine engines also failed to gain ground, for the reason that the fuels had restricted availability and hence were prohibitively expensive.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The petrol-powered internal combustion engine would emerge as the winner in the race to develop a self-powered vehicle, but the contest was a long, drawn-out affair. In the early stages, the eventual outcome was far from clear – with gas, steam and electric cars all vying for development funds and market share. Jean-Joseph Lenoir’s engine, though unsuccessful, was important as it attracted a great deal of attention, including a visit by an aspiring engineer called Gottlieb Daimler from Wurtemburg in southern Germany.</span> </p>
