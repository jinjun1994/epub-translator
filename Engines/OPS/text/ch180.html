<p><span class="style0">None of this did anything to dampen the enthusiasm of investors. Technology share prices were rising so fast that investors were quite willing to suspend their disbelief. This applied not just to private investors but to professional ones, many of whom either believed the hype or were so concerned about how their performance would look relative to their peers that they joined in the frenzy. The net impact was a stock market in which a relatively narrow segment provided incredible returns while returns from the wider market indices were disappointing by comparison. The reality was that even the returns from the wider indices were substantially higher than historical averages. This was also justified by reference to the new economy, the argument running that the Internet would have such a profound impact on the global economy that assumptions about the levels of non-inflationary growth that could be sustained in the long run were ratcheted upwards, making it easier to rationalise higher returns accruing to investors. In other words, the world was in the throes of a new Industrial Revolution.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The question for the investor was therefore: did the Internet really have the capacity to change the investment rules of past decades? Was it of a different order of magnitude to the other technological advances outlined in the earlier chapters of this book? We know the answer now, but it was not so apparent at the time. Analytically the answer to these questions was relatively straightforward. The Internet was sure to prove highly disruptive to existing business models and to enable all manner of future developments – but would it in practice be any more disruptive or transformational than previous advances? Consider the traditional light sources that involved harpooning whales and harvesting their blubber to fuel lamps as compared with electric light. Or take the health benefits and impact on mortality rates arising from the absence of manure on the streets that followed from the replacement of horse-drawn transportation – not to mention the wider revolutionising impact of the internal combustion engine on transport and logistics. In the space of 30 years human progress witnessed the emergence of the telephone, electric light and the automobile. This is the context within which the Internet needs to be considered.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Irrespective of background, eventually the value of all companies is anchored to their ability to deliver profits. The trajectory of sales growth is important, but the trajectory has to be sustainable and deliver bottom-line profitability at some point. As the late 1990s bubble developed, share prices ceased to be rooted in serious analysis. To any fundamental investor it was patently obvious that valuations in the TMT sector were massively and indiscriminately inflated. An individual company might survive and prosper, but in aggregate it was simply impossible for them all to be worth as much as they were priced to be. The Internet bubble is an example of collective absurdity to rank alongside such predecessors as the 1980s Japan bubble or the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s. As is normally the case, those who tried to counter the notion that it was a bubble did little to rebut the fundamental analysis, but instead implied that any criticism was down to either a lack of technological knowledge or a failure of imagination.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It was inevitable that in due course the excesses of previous bubbles would be repeated and the bubble would deflate, although it took longer than even the most hardened sceptics expected (to that extent they were indeed guilty of a lack of imagination). The following years duly produced a string of revelations about share-ramping scandals of a kind that had, of course, been associated with previous periods of excess. Conventional accounts of the period marvel at how so many Internet companies raised venture capital and were able to translate this into huge stock market gains before the bubble burst. The behaviour of those who helped to bring so many worthless companies to the public markets, and the dangers of the many conflicts of interest which they faced, also inevitably came under the spotlight. In one notorious case, the Merrill Lynch technology analyst Henry Blodget was penalised for expressing one view in public and a quite different one in private (for example, giving Excite the second-highest rating to investors but describing it as “such a piece of crap!” in private emails). This led to a $4m SEC fine and a permanent ban from the securities industry. This might have been one of the more egregious examples but it was not isolated. Such misdemeanors and displays of cynicism and greed did not differ significantly from history. Every stock market bubble has had them. Moreover, it was less than ten years later before similar venality was being displayed by the financial sector – culminating in the global financial crisis of 2008. In the financial crisis the ‘magic dust’ was not sprinkled upon increasing expected growth rates but rather on the supposed abolition of risk through the use of new and complex financial instruments.</span> </p>
