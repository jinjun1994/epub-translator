<p><span class="style0">If the gasoline-powered vehicle had established a very small beachhead in Europe, its presence in America was still largely non-existent. Daimler had made some headway in America in his venture with William Steinway. Daimler engines had sold well and his Daimler boats – retailing at anywhere between $815 ($60,000) to $7,000 ($0.5m) for a 50-foot launch – had found ready customers. However, the two motor vehicles that had been shipped and offered for sale remained unsold. Daimler fared little better at the World’s Columbian Exposition, held to commemorate the finding of America, in Chicago in 1893. Like the Paris Exposition that preceded it, Chicago decided a massive engineering centrepiece was in order. To this end, it commissioned an Illinois engineer named George Ferris to build an enormous wheel that would carry visitors high into the air, giving a spectacular view of the exposition area. Daimler displayed his vehicle at the exposition and it is recorded that one extremely interested visitor to his stand was an employee of the Detroit Edison Illuminating Company by the name of Henry Ford. Even the exposition, though, did not garner sufficient interest and it was only the reporting of the growth in sales of gasoline-powered vehicles in France that began to excite interest in America.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The interest was further stimulated by a series of road trials and races that were suggested and sponsored by newspapers to help increase circulation. The first trial took place between Paris and Rouen in July 1893, and featured vehicles powered by both steam and gasoline engines. For the record, the prize was won by two cars powered by Daimler engines, one of which had been built and entered by Peugeot. The excitement stimulated by this event was extensively reported in America and on Thanksgiving Day 1895, the</span> <span class="style1">Chicago Times-Herald</span> <span class="style0">inaugurated America’s first automobile race with $5,000 ($350,000) in prizes. The newspaper also commissioned a competition to name the new vehicles. The winning term of the competition was ‘motorcycle’, but its popularity was limited and eventually the term used in France – the ‘automobile’ – was adopted.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">With rallies now having taken place in America and France, Britain decided to follow suit. With the support of the company that had obtained the Daimler rights for the UK, a rally coined the ‘Emancipation Run’ was organised in 1896 between London and Brighton in an effort to get the restrictive red flag laws repealed. These laws had been enacted partly because of concern about safety, but primarily at the behest of the parties whose transport businesses were threatened by the emergence of the automobile. The law in Britain before 1896 specified that at least three men should drive the vehicle, that it should travel no faster than three miles per hour, and that it should also be preceded by a man carrying a red flag. When the laws were repealed in 1896, this allowed the industry to accelerate its efforts; a large number of companies began producing vehicles.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The popularity of the automobile was spreading and gaining influential friends. While global sales remained low in absolute terms, it was clear that the era of the automobile was on its way. As the press of the time shows, the key was the sequence of races. The great expositions and industrial shows undoubtedly helped as professional showcases for development in the nascent industry, but the general reporting of such shows was negligible by comparison to the column inches devoted to the races.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The Mercedes brand was one that emerged in the Daimler organisation in a somewhat unorthodox fashion. A wealthy commercial magnate in Vienna by the name of Emil Jellinek, working on the principle that if he ordered a large enough quantity he could influence the product, ordered four Daimler automobiles on the condition that they were capable of sustaining speeds in excess of 25 mph. Despite some misgivings, Daimler could not afford to turn down such a large order, and the four vehicles were duly delivered to Jellinek at his winter residence on the French Riviera. Jellinek subsequently sold two of the vehicles to Baron Henri de Rothschild whose ego – and wallet – had been stirred by Jellinek’s ability to easily overtake him on the roads of Nice. It was common at the time for drivers to enter races under pseudonyms, and Jellinek followed this practice using the name of his daughter: Mercedes. Despite the death of a Daimler foreman in one of the ‘fast’ cars demanded by Jellinek, the thirst for speed was sufficient to allow Jellinek to persuade Daimler to construct a new vehicle for him and give it the name ‘Mercedes’.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The real persuasion came in financial form. In early 1900 Jellinek offered Daimler an order for 36 vehicles with an estimated value of $130,000 (nearly $10m). All he required was the naming of the vehicles and the exclusive sales rights for America and a large part of Western Europe. The automobile that resulted has since been hailed as a masterpiece, with a top speed of 55 mph, more than 50% greater than its predecessors. The Mercedes totally surpassed its competitors and in particular left the small original Benz vehicles struggling in its wake. Despite the success of automobiles in France specifically, where restrictive legislation on automobile use had been largely absent, and Europe generally, the industry was about to be engulfed by a tidal wave from America.</span> </p>
