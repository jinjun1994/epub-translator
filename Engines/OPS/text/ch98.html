<h1 id="anchor_2754_0"><span class="style1">Conclusions</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">While the automobile industry had always displayed characteristics of concentration, even before its explosive growth occurred, a place in the top grouping only provided some security around 10–15 years after the industry emerged. The top grouping appeared relatively stable but was in no way insulated from the influence of the overall economy. Secular growth might have been strong but it was not exempt from cyclical influences. Companies that did not quickly cut their cloth to any economic downturn soon discovered the penalties a capital-intensive industry inflicts on those with product which cannot be sold and whose cash flow does not cover financing and operating costs. The automotive industry began by catering only to the very wealthy. It was an industry with multiple niche producers and at least three different competing technologies. From the very early stages it was clear that the existing technology of the horse-drawn carriage – and to a lesser extent the bicycle – were going to be displaced. Many manufacturers in these sectors sought to hedge their bets by entering the automobile industry, but Studebaker represented one of the few who successfully made the transition.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The ‘losers’ from the old technology were thus fairly easy to spot, but selection of which companies would prove the winners was much more difficult. Literally hundreds of companies sprung up, many of them genuine competitors, some of them effectively stock market scams. For the outsider there was little to distinguish between the genuine and the fake, let alone which of the genuine companies would succeed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Even the companies that did eventually succeed did so only after a rocky road. Henry Ford was successful only on his third corporate attempt and only after splitting with his partners over the strategic direction of the company. General Motors had to be rescued twice and Chrysler was effectively a company resuscitated from previous misfortune. Furthermore, it was only with the introduction of the Ford Model T, and its impact in bringing the automobile within the range of the affluent middle classes, that the market emerged as a strong growth one. From that point forward automobile production became an expanding market, but with a price point that was being continually lowered. Those that could not compete were forced to exit, in many cases moving in a very short period from a position of profitability and apparent stability to liquidation.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Despite the growth in demand and production, the car industry consolidated from the early part of the century onwards. There were many forces driving this, but principal among them was the initially fragile financial base of the majority of companies and the greater capital required for increased production volume and distribution. While production in the early years had concentrated on high-cost, high-margin vehicles, as the technology improved and the car became a product also for the middle classes the production process itself grew in importance. The economies to be gained from mass production militated against a large number of producers and the industry began an inexorable move towards consolidation.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Consolidation continued from that point forward. The initial very high returns on capital for the fortunate few gradually reduced, even as the consolidation took place, and the rate of growth in net income for participants was on a downward path almost from the 1920s until the 1970s – when, in real terms, profits followed the classic boom-and-bust cycle of a highly capital-intensive and competitive industry. In the early years, American manufacturers undoubtedly gained from the poor road conditions which forced the production of a more lightweight and standardised vehicle than their more technologically advanced European counterparts. In a domestic economy, growing strongly and protected by tariffs, the producers took full advantage to become the major players in the world industry.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There is an irony that external conditions forcing the development of a particular style of vehicle were to pay dividends for non-American producers many decades later. Most consumers outside America pay substantially higher gasoline prices than their US counterparts. As a consequence, fuel efficiency has typically been a factor of much higher importance in the design of automobiles for non-US markets. With the oil price shocks of the 1970s, American auto companies suddenly found themselves overtaken by their foreign, more fuel-efficient, counterparts. On both sides of the Atlantic, and latterly the Pacific, the investor was faced with the same issue: selecting a small number of survivors from a large number of initial competitors. Growth alone was not sufficient to underpin an investment. Returns might have been potentially very strong, but given the downside they needed to be. Equally, the investor needed to pay close attention to the profitability of the industry, since top-line growth alone proved no guarantee of income growth. During the very early stages when the technology was not fully understood and knowledge was not widespread, there existed many unscrupulous or unsubstantiated ventures and individuals who sought to remove funds from investors’ pockets.</span> </p>
