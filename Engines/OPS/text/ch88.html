<h1 id="anchor_2285_0"><span class="style1">Enter the Duryea brothers</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In 1895, the automobile largely created by Frank Duryea had won the</span> <span class="style1">Chicago Times-Herald</span> <span class="style0">race. The vehicle was the product of many years of work, which on a number of occasions had been sufficiently dispiriting in its lack of success that the project was nearly abandoned. Interest in the automobile had been stimulated by reports in</span> <span class="style1">Scientific American</span> <span class="style0">of the Benz automobile in Europe. Charles and Frank Duryea decided that, with their background in the bicycle industry and their knowledge of engineering and machining, they should be able to create an improved version of the vehicle. Together in 1892 they managed to persuade Erwin Markham of Springfield, Massachusetts, to invest part of his small savings to finance the project. Their early experience was not encouraging and Charles Duryea repaired to Illinois to work on a bicycle project with another group. This left Frank Duryea in the position of not only having to repair and sustain the confidence of his worried investor, but also seek to overcome the technical obstacles which had thus far proved insurmountable.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The first of these problems was to achieve controlled combustion, fundamental for an internal combustion engine. Eventually in 1893, after significant revisions to the existing engine, the combustion process was successfully achieved. The background to this was a grim economic and financial environment and a scepticism verging on ridicule from observers of the project. Sustaining Markham’s commitment in the face of this represented at least as important a task as the engineering problems. Although the first engine was neither powerful nor effective it was psychologically very important, for it convinced Markham to continue his backing for the venture. A new engine was constructed which was operationally superior and this allowed the road test of a vehicle in September 1893. The notes supplied to the press indicated the intent to form a joint stock company on the basis of a vehicle that, it was ‘estimated’, could be profitably sold for $400 (nearly $30,000). The test was successful in that the vehicle moved under its own power. However, the power generated by the engine was not great. Combined with an unsatisfactory transmission mechanism, this meant it could not move at any great speed, nor could it negotiate even a slight incline.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In order to address the transmission problem, Frank Duryea visited the Chicago Exposition in 1893, where he was able to view the Daimler automobiles imported by William Steinway. There in person he was able to ride on the ‘Otto’ four-stroke-engine-powered cars and inspect the clutch and gear transmission mechanisms. Returning to Springfield he set about persuading Markham to part with further funds. He was successful, although Markham’s resources were limited and Duryea had to lead a hand-to-mouth existence. In January 1894, after months of unpaid and arduous work, Duryea successfully demonstrated a reliable vehicle that could negotiate inclines. Certain alterations, such as brakes, were obviously required before commercial deployment could begin, but now there was a working prototype.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Unfortunately the move to the next stage of development was beyond Markham’s means and patience and another backer had to be found. Markham had invested nearly $3,000 (over $200,000) and new funds were required. On the back of the vehicle being developed, a new joint stock company was formed in September 1895. The Duryea Motor Wagon Company carries the distinction of being the first such company in America to solely concentrate on the automobile. The funds this raised allowed the completion of the new vehicle, which was wheeled out in time to win the Thanksgiving race in Chicago and receive the $2,000 prize.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Duryea vehicle might have been the first in America, but Frank Duryea was only one among many inventors frantically seeking to achieve the same goal. The principal barrier to entry was one that is common to most new industries in their formative stages. The initial public scepticism towards the automobile formed the backdrop to the banks’ assessment of their highly speculative nature. This convinced them of the wisdom of avoiding it as a destination for investment funds. The scepticism was also fuelled by the economic hardship and poor stock market conditions which prevailed during the early 1890s. The absence of funds from the banks did not unduly inhibit the initial development phase of the automobile, but it did help to focus early efforts on relatively high-priced automobiles where expenditure could be quickly recovered (the presumption being that the wealthy were relatively price-insensitive). For a new automobile manufacturer in this ‘cottage industry’ type of environment, all that was required was the mechanical knowledge, or at least a presumption that one had it, and the ability to persuade suppliers to provide materials on credit. Many existing and new companies were to try their hand at producing this new vehicle. There are estimates that in the 20 years that followed the first faltering steps of the Duryea automobile, there were over 1,000 and possibly as many as 1,500 automobile manufacturers in America.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Despite the early success of the Duryea vehicles, the company founded by the brothers did not survive long, becoming the victim of increasing sibling rivalry. In 1898 the Duryea Motor Wagon Company was sold to the National Motor Company and effectively closed after the production of 13 vehicles. Charles Duryea continued with the Duryea Manufacturing Company, which was established in 1898 with a capitalisation of $50,000 ($3.75m), although the actual funds raised amounted to just $3,400 ($250,000). Duryea retained the remainder of the unsold shares. Charles Duryea continued unsuccessfully to build motor vehicles and eventually ended up the editor of the</span> <span class="style1">Automobile Trade Journal</span><span class="style0">.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The efforts of Frank Duryea met with more success and his partnership with the Stevens Arms and Tool Company produced a business, the Stevens-Duryea Company, that manufactured high-end vehicles with varying degrees of success before being purchased by Westinghouse in 1916. For Frank Duryea, at least, there was some monetary reward – a payment of $500,000 ($22m) in return for his stake. Auto production continued for some time after this transaction, with the ownership structure taking various guises and the receivers never far from the door. Eventually, in 1924, the company sold its plant and property to the Springfield Body Company. Although the Duryeas had the first automobile company and substantial early success, it was not enough to make them a major market player. Their operations were swiftly overtaken by events. One other first that the Duryea automobile can lay claim to was the first recorded traffic accident, which took place in 1896 in New York City and resulted in the temporary arrest and imprisonment of the driver.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The excitement which increasingly surrounded the development of the horseless carriage almost inevitably attracted individuals who sought to translate this excitement into monetary gain. Some took the arduous and frustrating route of striving to produce better and cheaper vehicles. Others sought easier returns, raising capital based on expectations of future demand without any real intent to fulfil this demand. One of these was a gentleman by the name of Edward J. Pennington, who formed numerous companies on the back of his alleged expertise in engine technology, the valuable patents he held, and his ability to produce motor vehicles which would quickly capture market share. Like all stock promoters, he was sufficiently technically knowledgeable on the subject to persuade the financial press of his intentions and in the receptive mood of the time was able to raise funds. Photographs and plans of his ‘vehicles’ appeared in the trade and financial press, allowing substantial funds to be raised. Even though the validity of his claims was shown to be lacking in substance, Pennington demonstrated that a slightly altered message or geographic location was often all that was required to allow capital-raising exercises to be repeated if the environment was sufficiently optimistic.</span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">A case of hot air</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">In November 1895 the first edition of the new magazine</span> <span class="style0">The Horseless Age</span> <span class="style1">was published. The magazine was dedicated to the emerging motor vehicle industry. In its first edition it featured a number of vehicles with different forms of propulsion. The first was the ‘Spring Motor Quadricycle’, a vehicle powered by a wound spring which it was hoped could cover three miles at a speed of 20 mph on one winding, assuming no gradients. More attention was paid to the Duryea Motor Vehicle, which was to be entered in the</span> <span class="style0">Times-Herald</span> <span class="style1">race, and the race itself commanded many column inches. Space was also given to a number of electrics such as the Electrobat, but the largest single entry on a motor vehicle referred to the Kane-Pennington Hot Air Engine and the Racine Motor Vehicle Company. This entry provided a relatively detailed and seemingly technical explanation of the operation of the Pennington engine and the vehicles which carried it. These ranged from four-wheeled vehicles to motor bicycles and included illustrations and photographs such as that for the most recent version detailed below. This vehicle was the Fan-Motor Bicycle and was presented as the latest advance: “[a]t an exhibition given in Milwaukee, Wis, recently, Mr Pennington covered a mile on his motor cycle in 58 seconds” (i.e. over 60 mph). Further, the article noted that a “number of the large bicycle manufacturers are preparing to apply Kane Pennington engines to their machines, and motor cycles will be a familiar sight before the close of 1896”.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<div class="img_container"><img src="../images/image_96.jpg" style="width:486px;height:363px;" alt="image_96.jpg" /></div>
<p><span class="style1">The enthusiasm for motor vehicles was not surprising given the express purpose of the journal was the promotion of the new industry. Equally, in an embryonic industry, the claims of manufacturers and new companies were no doubt difficult to validate. Certainly, within a relatively short period of time, the enthusiasm which had greeted Pennington’s commercial endeavours was replaced by a different set of emotions. In the June 1896 edition the following article appeared, under the heading ‘Beelzebub’:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“Persons interested on this side of the Atlantic have read with mingled feelings the deluge of humbug and bluff with which E. J. Pennington, aforetime of America, has been flooding the motor press of England and the Continent. These feelings have passed through the various phases of amazement and indignation, and we have at length settled into such a deep disgust that we are compelled to doubt whether our English cousins really possess the good sense with which they are commonly supposed to be endowed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“Jumping bicycles, terrible flying machines for use in war, motor carriages and bicycles of marvellous fleetness parade through the pages of these foreign journals, interlarded with interviews and puffs of the inventor himself that touch ‘the very base string of humility.’ He is compared to Napoleon in the magnificent sweep of his genius, and the charms of his person are fulsomely recited to complete the seductive picture.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“Meantime the recipient of all this adulation luxuriates in an elegant suite at a leading London hotel, and plots new surprises to spring upon a credulous world…</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“Just what the relationship between Thomas Kane and Co. and E. J. Pennington was never very clear. Thomas Kane told the editor of</span> <span class="style0">The Horseless Age</span> <span class="style1">that Pennington was not associated with him in business; that he simply manufactured motors for Pennington, or the Racine Motor Vehicle Company, one of the many aliases under which Pennington has operated.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“Quite a number of these motors were made and sold under different nom-de-plumes – hot air engines, electro-oil engines, etc. – while the magic effects of double sparking and refrigerating cylinders were harped upon so effectively that many persons of ordinarily good judgement were led to part with their money.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“Complaints of this motor began to come to the editor from all sides. The general verdict was that it was absolutely worthless, and having satisfied himself as to the character of the man and the motor, the editor instructed his Chicago agent to accept no advertisement from any one wishing to advertise Pennington motors or vehicles.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“…Realizing that he had outworn his welcome here, he set out for the green fields of England to repeat his performance there, and from the very moment of his landing the tide of puffery and misrepresentation has been rising in the English press.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“And what of this English Kane-Pennington Company? Who constitute it? Has Thomas Kane made in England an alliance which he would not make in America?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“It passes belief that this adventurer has been able to worm himself into the confidence of the promoters of the industry in England. That he has done so is not to their credit.”</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Although the editorial piece has a somewhat sanctimonious ring to it given the column inches previously devoted to the prospects for Pennington vehicles, it does illustrate the difficulty which faced investors. Not only did the investor have to decide upon the likely success of competing technologies, but even after this verdict had been reached, he had to distinguish between companies some of whom were effectively fraudulent and only incorporated for the purpose of raising funds from investors. Since for some promoters this was their main purpose it should not be surprising that they were well aware of the need to fool an often credulous press. The answer for investors presumably lay in waiting for a trading history, the delivery of actual profits and audited statements. Given that at the time the investment had to be based on the future prospects of an exciting new concept this would have effectively meant not participating and leaving the investment to those who would now be described as venture capitalists.</span> </p>
