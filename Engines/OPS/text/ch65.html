<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Edison Electric Illuminating Company was incorporated in December 1880 with the purpose of funding the development of Edison’s lighting system. After the research work, the next step for Edison was a commercial demonstration. The US site he chose was Lower Manhattan, an area which included within its boundaries the financial district, the New York Stock Exchange and many of the financial and banking powerhouses of America. This was the scene of one of Edison’s earlier triumphs – the invention of the stock ticker machine. Perhaps as a consequence, his plan was enthusiastically received by both the press and his financial backers.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Edison was to construct a central generating plant which would supply the electricity for his lighting system, but before he could do this he had a number of obstacles to overcome. In order to lay the necessary power cabling he had to obtain the permission of the New York City Board of Aldermen. The aldermen had to be persuaded of the merits of electricity over the gas lighting system with which many of them were comfortable, and allow the streets to be dug for cables for this new untried venture. Edison tackled the problem with his normal aplomb. The aldermen were provided with a discourse on the technical aspects of his system at his Menlo Park laboratory. When boredom was obviously setting in, Edison clapped his hands and the room was illuminated by incandescent lamps to reveal tables groaning with food provided by New York’s Delmonico’s restaurant.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">4.11 – Stepping up the propaganda barrage: extract from Edison Electric ‘news’ bulletins, designed to maintain confidence</span> </p>
<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style1">Edison Electric Light Company Bulletins</span> <span class="style0">2 (7 February 1882) and 6 (27 March 1882).</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Edison Electric Illuminating Company was granted the franchise in April 1881. This company licensed its technology from Edison Electric and after many practical problems, innumerable missed deadlines and an expenditure of $480,000 (triple the original budget and equivalent to roughly $38m today) the Pearl Street Station and its distribution cables were completed. Operation began on 4 September 1882 and by the end of that year the company served a district of one square mile with just over 1,000 lamps. Twelve months later it had grown to service over 500 customers, with over 10,000 lamps. Edison sought to counter the negative press regarding his progress by circulating ‘Bulletins’ of press cuttings, which recorded any favourable comment on his work and any negative comment on gas lighting (see figure 4.11). These bulletins were passed to agents of Edison Electric and to the press.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the early phases, lamps which cost $1.40 to manufacture were sold at $0.40. The simple reason was that they had to be held at competitive price levels until such time as the industry was established and the infrastructure built out sufficiently to allow economies of scale to kick in. This loss-making price was held constant for an extended period and it was a number of years until the production cost finally fell to $0.22 and both positive cash flow and profits could be recorded. This was achieved only after capital expenditure exceeding $50m (nearly $4bn). The Pearl Street Station sold electric lighting below cost for an extended period and operated at a loss until 1890 when it finally turned profitable, only to suffer the ignominy of being destroyed by fire.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the wider industry context, though, it was an unqualified success. Although the lack of profitability made the Edison company wary of investing further and bankers such as J. P. Morgan were concerned by the extremely heavy capital cost and the lack of an adequate return to justify it, others were more willing to invest on the perception of future profits to be earned. Perhaps the explanation was public perception versus the private financial knowledge of the participants. Whatever the reason, by June 1882, 67 Edison plants had been constructed under franchise and utilities in cities as far apart as Detroit, New Orleans, Boston and Chicago. Within a further four years there were over 700 stations powering over 180,000 lamps in the US alone.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style1">The annual accounts of the Edison Electric Light Company are not particularly revealing, and even between the years of 1885 and 1886 substantial changes took place in their structure which serve to obscure the underlying picture. In 1885, items which would normally be taken as expense items on the profit-and-loss account were capitalised on the balance sheet. Presumably the absence of meaningful profits in the start-up phase influenced the decision to treat them in such a manner. By 1886 some of these expenses had been removed to a separately shown profit-and-loss account. The asset side of the balance sheet had been maintained largely by including, under stocks and bonds, the Edison railway company and higher values for the Electric Illuminating companies. Edison Electric was effectively a patent holding company, so to the extent that new licences were granted in return for stock, it would have been legitimate to increase assets on the balance sheet accordingly. This, though, would not account for the change in treatment year to year. It also means that the assets on the balance sheet and profits would largely be at the discretion of the company, since the treatment of experimental expenses continued to be capitalised. Furthermore, the patents themselves had a limited lifespan and would require to be depreciated over the longer term – and, as the reports indicated, protection from infringement was also required in the shorter term, necessitating a litigation reserve.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style1">The profit stream recognised by the company included two main components. Firstly there was the issuance of new licences and the net receipts received, normally in the form of stock in the licencee company. Secondly, there were the licence fees paid from the profits of the licencee company. Long-term profits therefore depended upon the underlying success of these operating companies. This in turn depended upon the trade-off between the initial cost of building the infrastructure and the ongoing revenues received from clients. Although the annual reports make glowing references to the increasing list of new operating companies taking licences, there are also references to the litigation from the partially owned Edison Illuminating Company of New York regarding the excessive cost of the Pearl Street Station. In other words, for the investor, detailed analysis of the accounts would have revealed a holding company with two main assets, the patents on electric light and holdings in a number of generating companies. There would have been little evidence of either cash flow or profits. An appropriate share price would have had to be determined by reference to the potential success of the operating companies, most of which were only in their formative years and not yet yielding a meaningful return on a high level of capital expenditure.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">While sketchy in nature, the accounts do reveal enough to show that the company would be susceptible to cash flow problems, irrespective of the ultimate success of its operations. This is ultimately how it turned out. The requirement for additional funding arrived during an economic downturn, when existing investors found themselves short of capital. As a consequence, despite various earlier attempts at consolidation, the company was eventually merged with its competitor, Thomson-Houston, to form General Electric. The prime driving force in this was J. P. Morgan, with the creation of GE being one of his earlier attempts at consolidating an industry.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style1">So far as the operating arms were concerned, the evolution of the business proceeded along the lines that would be expected of a highly capital-intensive business. That is, sales and net income gradually expanded, raising the returns earned on the asset base, and allowing margins to increase gradually as costs were amortised over a growing revenue stream. Reflecting the stability of income flows, expansion was financed through debt expansion rather than equity. The early years, where cost overruns bedeviled the project, eventually gave way to a more stable operating environment.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Drexel, Morgan and Company spearheaded Edison’s expansion across Europe and soon most European countries followed the example of London, where Edison’s first ever station had been constructed at Holborn Viaduct. Edison’s success only spurred on his competitors, most notably the Thomson-Houston Company, George Westinghouse and the United States Electric Lighting Company, newly created by merger. The possibility that electric light might prevail against gas, and the profits this would produce, also led to an extended period of litigation over patents.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the first instance, Edison had headed off a protracted legal battle in the UK by agreeing to merge his British subsidiary with Swan’s company; in 1883 the Edison and Swan Electric Light Company was formed. However, around the time of the British merger with Swan, Edison was rocked by a decision from the US commissioner of patents which ruled that William Sawyer had precedence over Edison for the electric lamp. This ruling set the stage for a battle that took nearly eight years to reach its conclusion. The Edison Electric Light share price plunged to $130 and the European equivalent found no potential purchasers. In response, and in order to protect their position, the Edison companies were forced to initiate over 200 lawsuits and spend over $2m ($150m today) in defence of their patents. The matter was only resolved in 1892 when the Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court’s 1891 finding in favour of Edison.</span> </p>
