<h1 id="anchor_602_0"><span class="style1">The heyday of canals</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Industrial Revolution mechanised the production of many bulk goods and textiles and created a requirement to shift these goods from central production points to market. Advances in engineering and construction techniques helped to make possible the construction of a myriad of canals upon which the goods could be shipped. With their viaducts, bridges and tunnels, the canals quickly captured most of the market for land-based transportation of goods. Their costs were barely one third of the main alternatives, horse-drawn containers and coastal ships. Passenger and mail traffic remained the preserve of the horse and carriage.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Between the late 18th century and 1824, more than 60 canal companies were created, raising more than £12 million of new capital, equivalent to some $12 billion in today’s money. Demand for canal shares was so great that capital was widely obtained from public subscription on an unprecedented scale. Many of the issues were substantially oversubscribed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">At first this enthusiasm appeared relatively well founded. Some historians have noted that many British canals provided substandard returns for investors. Over the full life of the canal system, this may have been true. However, before the railways emerged to take away their market, canals did provide strong absolute and relative share price performance. As with many infrastructure projects, the problem for canal investors was the continuing need for large capital outlays. To recoup such heavy upfront investment required an extended period of profitable operation. The arrival of the railways denied canal investors this necessary period of capital recovery and provides a timeless lesson for investors attracted by the lure of a new technology.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Any technology that necessitates heavy capital expenditure and requires returns to be earned over an extended period is always going to be a high-risk undertaking – unless, that is, there is some form of protection against competition. This protection may take the form of patent, copyright, legal prohibition or simply fundamental competitive advantage (such as a superior cost curve). There is an obvious parallel between what happened with the canals and the debate about the prospects for third-generation (3g) telecommunication licences at the time of the first edition of this book in 2001. In both cases, massive amounts of capital expenditure were committed but without any guarantee that the new technology would enjoy a sufficiently long period of dominance in which to earn back, let alone exceed, the capital cost.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The mid-1820s was the last period of investor enthusiasm for canals in Britain. This was a time of general enthusiasm for new issues. In 1824–25, more than £370m was invested in 600 new companies, a huge sum equivalent to $300bn today. To put it in context, this was roughly equivalent to the peak (year-2000) total annual global capital expenditure on telecommunications – including, wireless, optical cabling and broadband! Canals and railways accounted for 15% of this total, the single largest category of investment other than collective investment schemes. This was the high water mark for the canals – though, as figure 1.2 shows, it was not until the 1830s, when the railways began to undercut and displace them, that canal share prices began to be badly affected. The new railways could ship goods at prices at least one third lower than the canals, which were forced to drop their prices significantly in order to remain competitive.</span> </p>
