<p><span class="style0">The need for increased computational power that Babbage had sought to address was a real one. Whether it was nautical tables, the rising analytical demands created by the Industrial Revolution or the needs of government, the pressure to reduce costs and increase the speed of data processing was intense. In Britain, the business sector mainly sought to refine existing methods to increase efficiency. In America, the approach was different. Most companies had no historic baggage in their operations – in the terminology of today, they did not suffer the problems of ‘legacy systems’. In the event, the first large-scale use of mechanical aids in the computation and tabulation of figures came at the behest of the US government. Like Napoleon in France nearly a hundred years before, the root of need lay in the government’s appetite for revenue.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Fundamental to government was a knowledge of exactly who was being governed, which meant holding a regular census. Census taking was a massive data-gathering and processing exercise that took many years to complete, meaning that by the time usable information was available in tabular form, it was likely to be out of date. As the population of the industrialised world was growing rapidly, it was simply not feasible for the process to be sped up without recourse to mechanical aids. To give an idea of the growth, the 1840 census in America recorded a population of just over 17 million people. The census was conducted by 28 clerks. In 1860 the equivalent numbers were 31 million people and 184 clerks; ten years later, 38 million people and 438 clerks. By 1880 the population had reached 50 million, and the census took 1,495 clerks and seven years to <span id="anchor_3359_148"></span>produce.<a href="ch135.html#anchor_3641_0">⁷⁸</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It was against this background that the US Census Bureau under Robert Porter organised a competition to evaluate potential alternatives to the laborious manual tally process that had been employed in previous censuses. The trial took place in St Louis. It featured two similar systems, one that used a colour-coding system to speed up the manual process, and the second a punched-card system which tabulated mechanically. The speed with which results could be tabulated once the cards had been completed proved the decisive factor. The card-based system won the competition comprehensively. The Hollerith Electric Tabulating System was awarded the contract for the 1890 census, and the company subcontracted the production of equipment to the Bell subsidiary Western Electric. The 1890 census proved a success. It was estimated that the cost of producing the census, nearly $12m ($865m), was roughly a third lower thanks to the new machines. The time to publication, two and half years, was nearly two thirds less than the time taken to publish the results of the 1880 census.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Although the reduction in the time to completion was undeniable, the cost saving was later challenged. As the estimate was provided by Porter, it was not unbiased. The fact was that, for all the hypothetical saving, the cost of the 1890 census was still double that of its predecessor ten years earlier. Whatever the truth of the cost estimates, the Hollerith system certainly revolutionised large-scale data collection and tabulation. Henceforth data processing need not have its boundaries set by the limitations of manual tabulation. The success was recognised globally, with enquiries and contracts being received from as far afield as Scandinavia, Central and Eastern Europe.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style1">“Woe, especially, to the worker who slacked off on the job. Hearing of an employee who spent an excessive amount of time reading the newspaper in the lavatory, Hollerith devised his own solution to the problem. He drove nails upward through the toilet seat, filing them smooth where they emerged. From their heads protruding underneath he ran wires back to his office nearby, where they were attached to a magneto that sat on his desk. Watching through a peephole from his office for the malingerer to take up his reading habit, the inventor gave the magneto crank a sudden turn, sending a shock along the toilet seat.”</span> </p>
