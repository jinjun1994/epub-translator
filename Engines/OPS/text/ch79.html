<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The antitrust case against Standard Oil did not appear unduly threatening in the first instance. It began with an investigation into issues relating to the Kansas oilfields and the company’s alleged misuse of its control over the oil transportation systems. Previous trust investigations into a range of industries had not proven particularly damaging, and this perhaps led to some complacency at Standard Oil. The investigation exposed the (by now) time-honoured practice of thinly disguised illegal subsidies. Indeed, between 1904 and 1906 Standard Oil found itself besieged with cases raised against its operating subsidiaries in pretty much every US state where it had major operations. After James Garfield, the commissioner of corporations, released his first set of conclusions in May 1906, the number of actions escalated.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">In seeking election in 1904, Theodore Roosevelt was happy to fan the flames of concern over the apparent power of the largest companies in America. This was juxtaposed with equal enthusiasm for receiving campaign funds from the self-same sources. Nearly three quarters of Roosevelt’s campaign funds came from big business, including amounts ranging from $50,000 to $150,000 from luminaries such as J. P. Morgan, C. S. Mellon and $100,000 solicited by the Republican campaign treasurer from Standard Oil. The source of these funds led the newspapers to allege hypocrisy and speculate whether Roosevelt had any incentive to act against the trusts he publicly decried. Roosevelt responded by suggesting the return of the funds from Standard Oil. It is questionable whether the suggestion was not somewhat disingenuous, at least if the later account of William Taft is to be believed:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">“[Attorney General] Knox said he came into the office of Roosevelt one day in October 1904, and heard him dictating a letter directing the return of the $100,000 to the Standard Oil Company. He said to him ‘Why, Mr. President, the money has been spent. They cannot pay it back – they haven’t got it.’ ‘Well,’ said the President, ‘the letter will look well on the record anyhow,’ and so he let it <span id="anchor_2082_74"></span>go.”<a href="ch80.html#anchor_2165_0">⁴⁸</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Not only therefore was the contribution kept, but the party treasurer later sought a further $150,000 from Standard Oil – which, perhaps unsurprisingly, was this time refused.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The cases covered the whole range of Standard’s operations, not just transportation and storage of product but also the sale of subsidiary products such as lubricating oils. One such case was an investigation into the purchasing practices of railroads in regard of lubricating oils. This did not appear a particularly threatening case, as it was a relatively insignificant market, but it quickly threw the relationship between Standard Oil and the railroads into clear relief. Garfield’s investigation found that outside Pennsylvania (where the competition was most intense) Standard Oil used the threat of its relationship in the carriage of freight to ensure that contracts flowed to its subsidiary, the Galena-Signal Oil Company. Officials argued that they were not aware that Galena was a Standard Oil subsidiary, that its oils were superior, or some combination of both. In November 1906, following publication of the report, the federal government filed a bill in equity against Standard Oil of New Jersey and seven of its directors asking that the entity be found a monopoly and in conspiracy of restraint of trade under the definition of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The prepared remedy was that Jersey Standard should be stripped of its stock holdings in its operating subsidiaries. The subsidiaries were to be given complete independence.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Other than the institution of the federal case, the last big development was a decision in August 1907 against Standard Oil of Ohio by Judge Landis and the award of aggregate damages against the company of over $29m ($1.7bn). Shortly after this decision, the ‘Prices and Profits’ section of the Bureau of Corporations report was released. This report was again a damning indictment of Standard Oil, including special reference to Galena Oil, and further inflamed public opinion. Standard Oil’s efforts to counter the poor publicity were too little too late. The groundswell of adverse public opinion encouraged the political decision to pursue the company even more vigorously in the courts. President Roosevelt, who had previously shown little interest in the trusts, led the charge against Standard Oil, though the case was to last beyond his presidency. In 1909 the federal court found against Standard Oil and ordered its dissolution. Not surprisingly the company appealed against the decision and sought to continue the fight at both the legal and public relations level. Despite Standard Oil’s efforts to counter the arguments on pricing and unreasonable returns, the Supreme Court upheld the earlier decision and ordered the dissolution of the trust. Standard Oil was given six months from 21 June 1911 to complete the dissolution process.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style1">Wall Street Journal</span><span class="style0">, 26 July 1911.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The company was subdivided, largely according to its geographic operating units. The original holding company became Standard Oil of New Jersey (Exxon) and was by some distance the largest single entity, accounting for over 40% of the assets of the trust. The next largest operation was Standard Oil of New York (Mobil), with approximately 10%. Other companies included: Standard Oil of California (Chevron), Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio, which later became a division of BP, subsequently BP Amoco), Standard Oil of Indiana (Amoco), Continental Oil (Conoco) and Atlantic Oil (ARCO). The stock market listing of these companies, though, was not to take place until after World War I.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style1">Wall Street Journal</span><span class="style0">, 19 May 1914.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">At the time, opinion was split as to the value of the different subsidiaries. Many believed the value of the combined operation was diminished by its breakup. In general the response to the dissolution fell into two camps, both critical. The first group argued that small shareholders would be disadvantaged by the number of different shares they would be receiving and the relative lack of knowledge they had about the 35 individual operating entities. The second response was concerned with the impact on the structure of the industry. There were fears that the increased number of competitors would lead to greater instability in pricing and threaten the independent producers. The view was also expressed that the dissolution would automatically lead to higher costs for the new operating companies, which would then increase prices to consumers. Ironically, then, the same press which had some years before castigated Standard Oil for monopoly practices and restraint of trade was how bemoaning its breakup as heralding instability and higher prices. However, the concern over the economic benefits of the breakup neglected the changing demand characteristics associated with the automobile and oil-powered shipping, particularly on the military side. As a consequence, before long the press was recanting, shifting back towards the anti-monopolistic view.</span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">Union Oil versus Standard Oil of California</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Although Union Oil had competed against Standard Oil in California for some considerable time, it was only with the dissolution of the Standard Oil Trust that annual reports specific to the Californian company became available. The comparison between the two companies therefore runs for the ten-year period after dissolution. In 1911 the two companies both had net income of approximately $3.5m ($190m). The return on assets was also broadly comparable between the two companies, as Unocal earned the return on $59m of assets and Standard Oil on $49m. In terms of return on equity, the figures looked better for Unocal because, where Standard Oil’s balance sheet had virtually no debt, Unocal ran a moderate level of financial gearing. One would have expected Standard Oil to show a higher return, if only because it applied a much higher rate of depreciation to its assets. Put otherwise, a comparison of the book value of assets would understate the position of Standard Oil relative to Unocal.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">From 1911 onwards the picture begins to change dramatically. Unlike Unocal, Standard Oil was able consistently to lift its production and shipment of refined product. When this was combined with the depreciated assets position, returns grew substantially. The return on assets rose even during the tough pricing environment of 1912–1914 and sharply thereafter when price movements began to come through. Unocal’s net income remained stagnant, only rising with pricing. As a consequence, in a weak pricing environment, the company was unable to hold its dividend and had to divert cash to maintain its debt position at reasonable levels. For the investor, the progress made by Unocal over the ten-year period to 1920 would have been reasonable. It remained a well-positioned company in a growing market. However, the difference in performance between Standard Oil’s California business as a Standard Oil subsidiary and as a standalone company was striking. Net income for Standard Oil of California was ten times higher in 1920 than it was in 1911 and even if this figure was abnormally high, the growth rate was certainly not much less than 30% comparable per annum. Unocal’s stock note by contrast has roughly half that level. What is more, the growth in net income of Standard Oil had not been achieved at the expense of a weakened balance sheet or shareholder dilution. The Standard Oil shareholder had been rewarded with a consistently high cash dividend and frequent stock distributions. At the end of the period, therefore, the net assets of Standard Oil were more than two and a half times those of Unocal. It might have been a growing history, but there were very different returns to be earned by different companies. Those who doubted the ability of Standard Oil subsidiaries when out from under the umbrella of the trust were proved definitively wrong.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The operating environment for the new companies was very different from that which prevailed at the beginning of the century. Until that earlier point, the principal product refined from crude oil was kerosene. The volatile, lighter end product, gasoline – which represented under 20% of a barrel – was mostly disposed of as waste. Refining needs changed dramatically in the early 1900s, however, as kerosene gave way to electric lighting and production of the automobile began its exponential growth. Lubricants and kerosene now took second place to gasoline. Instead of a single area dominating world production, there were multiple producing regions and nations. Finally, instead of a single company effectively controlling the entire global industry, new powerful competitors were emerging.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">General opinion at the time – including that of the operators themselves – had not yet realised the potential of the new automobile industry. Before World War I, the consumable on which the companies focused remained kerosene. Transportation was recognised as a growth area, but few saw automobiles as the daily force. Rather, the focus was on the use of heavier oils for powering large engines and supplanting coal as a fuel. In this regard the target consumers were locomotives and the shipping industry, particularly navies. Union Oil of California made mention of the growing prospects for oil as a locomotive and maritime fuel in its 1911 annual report, but it was not until after the end of World War I that any mention was made of demand for gasoline. Nevertheless, the profitable condition of oil companies can be seen by a comparison of the two major operators in the Californian market.</span> </p>
