<p><span class="style0">Gould was by no means finished either as railroad operator, financier or stock market manipulator. Within a short space of time he was using his vast wealth to gain control of Union Pacific. The battle for control of the Erie Railroad had many elements to it. Railroads were profitable for those who controlled them, due largely to the lax legal controls of the time. The ability to issue stock and manipulate a market enamoured by the industry’s growth prospects allowed vast private fortunes to be made. For the railroads themselves, profitable operation depended upon the ability to link producers with consumers, meaning a through route to urban centres and points of embarkation for manufactured, agricultural and extracted goods. The heavy fixed costs involved in setting up a railroad meant it was a natural monopoly. In the early days railroad entrepreneurs used any means possible to become that monopoly, and to receive the pricing premium that accompanied it. The fight for control of the Erie Railroad epitomised all these things, but the end of that particular battle only set the stage for the next development. If</span> <span class="style1">combination</span> <span class="style0">was not to be allowed, it was only natural for the operators to try and</span> <span class="style1">collude</span> <span class="style0">in a price-fixing cartel.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Vanderbilt had not been alone in his efforts to put together a link to Chicago. By the mid-1870s, in addition to the Erie Railroad, there were a further four main systems extending from the Atlantic seaboard to Chicago. Each had pursued a similar course, connecting a succession of shorter lines to complete a through route. Vanderbilt summed up the situation succinctly: “Five great railroads to New York, with only business enough for two of them.” The first casualty of the price war that inevitably unfolded was the Erie Canal, which followed the same slow decline experienced by the canals in Britain.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">To an extent, the next casualties were the railroads themselves. There were various attempts to form price-fixing cartels, but on each occasion the price war soon broke out again between at least two of the participants. It was not until 1877 that a more stable price-fixing pool was concluded. The driving force behind this came from outside America, notably from European investors who had invested heavily in American railroads, experiencing some significant financial failures – for example, the collapse of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and the New Jersey Railroad in late 1876. When the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad fell out with Baring Brothers, it fell to J. P. Morgan and Company to raise funds in Britain. Their unsuccessful attempts to raise funds brought home how much scepticism British investors had towards the financial accounts of American railroads. This experience was an important factor in pushing the railroads towards a pooling and price-setting agreement.</span> </p>
