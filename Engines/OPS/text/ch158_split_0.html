<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Innovative as the work of Engelbart and Nelson was, it remained of peripheral importance to funding bodies. Defence was the core function. The research on networking took place in a devolved framework, with different groups working on different segments of the project. Although the research on networking was mainly conducted in a university environment, the sponsor remained the US Department of Defense. Over the next two to three years, other nodes were added to the system, but the lack of immediate uses looked as if it was going to consign the work to a side role, or backup that would only be required in desperate defence conditions – or what Licklider called the “rare occasion”.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">To combat this, a conference was organised to try and stimulate interest and ongoing support. The International Conference on Computer Communications was held in Washington in October 1972. Like all good marketing efforts it included a number of headline-catching demonstrations. It boasted, for example, a hypothetical psychotic character at UCLA being programmed by a hypothetical doctor at BBN. It had remote games of chess and quizzes, but more importantly it involved the first use of a new application, which was later to prove a driving force in the development of the Internet. This was email, which had preceded the APRANET but had then developed to assist interaction and coordination between users. The conference made public the existence of the ARPANET, the possibility of international communication and the evolving email functionality. That this functionality would give rise to the Internet of today was not recognised at the time. The reporting of the new network was subdued to say the least, though. It appeared to be viewed as another scientific advance without much relevance to the wider world.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">10.1 – And the press reports the new network</span> </p>
<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style1">New York Times</span><span class="style0">, 15 April 1972.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Fundamental to this evolution was the concept that the ARPANET would be a network for packet switching, based on a foundation of open architecture. In open architecture, any individual network of computers can hook up to the central networking as long as it conforms to a particular set of standards, or in the jargon ‘a meta-level internetworking architecture’. This allows individual networks to be designed for their own specific purpose, rather than having to conform to a more restrictive structure. A key requirement of any open architecture system has to be that the ‘internetworking’ is robust. This resulted in a communications protocol named the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP). A version of TCP/IP was written as a collaboration between Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf and presented in September 1973.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This work was extended with funding from DARPA (as ARPA had become). Between 1974 and 1979, four progressively refined versions were produced. The versions were tested and the fourth version was eventually accepted as the standard. The TCP/IP protocol was used to connect the ARPANET via terrestrial, radio and satellite links. The initial earth stations for the satellite connection were in the USA and the UK, but soon further stations were added in Germany, Norway and Italy. At the time, the personal computer industry remained in its infancy and the main connections were of necessity between large scientific complexes.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The main users, though, remained the military. By 1979, 46 sites on the ARPANET were in the military/industrial sphere, as compared to 16 academic campus <span id="anchor_4166_26"></span>sites.<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4881_0">⁹⁶</a> The development of the ARPANET increased the need for some form of coordination of protocols and the configuration of gateways (what we now know as ‘routers’). To this end, ARPA set up what later became the Internet Activities Board (IAB). With increasing participation by groups other than the military, the Department of Defense saw the need to separate its networking requirements from those of the other users. Thus, in the early 1980s, the Department of Defense’s own network was set up, but continued to use the TCP/IP standard and retained access to the ARPANET. The ARPANET gradually came to be known by its popular name, the Internet.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In reality, the original network was taken out of service as its successors increased in importance. The importance of the Internet as a connection medium had not gone unnoticed, and the National Science Foundation in America had begun to provide funding support to allow increasing numbers to gain access to the ARPANET. Further support was forthcoming during the 1980s from the federal government, which set up the NSFNET to provide high-speed links between its supercomputing centres for academics and the centres themselves. The rationale for linking the five supercomputers was effectively the same as it had been for the original networking of mainframes. Supercomputers were very expensive, and there could only be a limited number of them. If widespread access was required a network therefore had to be provided; timeshare again! The supercomputer links were augmented by links to regional networks, which provoked a wide range of educational institutions to connect to the NSFNET. In 1987, the NSF commissioned a group of companies, including IBM and MCI, to improve and manage the supercomputer network, which had begun to struggle as traffic growth threatened to overwhelm the system. The main cause of this was the enthusiastic adoption of email, the application that had been revealed at the Washington conference 15 years before.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The group commissioned by the NSF upgraded the network by replacing old lines with connections able to run at substantially higher speeds. The consequent higher functionality and specification of NSFNET led to it effectively replacing the ARPANET, which was finally decommissioned in 1990. Subsequently another network named the National Research and Education Network (NREN) was created, sitting initially on top of the NSFNET, and funded by the Al-Gore-sponsored bill to service the needs of ‘lower’ education. The Internet had arrived.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">When the original protocols were being formulated in the early 1970s, the vision upon which they were based was one of linking large national networks. The expectation was based on the ARPANET model and hence only a small number of such creations were anticipated. Although technologies for linking local computers – the ethernet – were under development at Xerox at the time, the evolution of the Internet was not foreseen by those directly involved. As a consequence, the expectation that the number of networks that would be linked would not exceed 256 determined the initial methodology employed to define addresses. This assumption was not to remain underpinned for very long as both the ethernet and personal computers dramatically rearranged the working model. No longer was there simply a small number of large national networks, but to this were added a growing number of regional networks and an exploding number of local area networks. A system that could only accommodate 256 networks was inadequate and the growth required a new naming system, hence the domain name system (DNS). Early pioneers did foresee that the Internet would have commercial potential but focused primarily on the knowledge/data sharing aspects and hence on how developing the infrastructure for such activity could be financed.</span> </p>
