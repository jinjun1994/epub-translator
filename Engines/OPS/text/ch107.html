<h1 id="anchor_2862_0"><span class="style1">The market starts to develop</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Marconi was not alone in his quest for wireless telegraphy, but he was probably the one most focused on its commercial application. His early competitors were scientists first and businessmen second, although undoubtedly all would have been influenced by the fortunes created by the success of Western Union and more recently AT&amp;T and GE. These companies offered investors a new type of investment. Investors had typically relied on the railroads and bonds as ‘reliable’ investments, while viewing industrial companies as high-risk speculative vehicles. This was ironic, given the scandals associated with the railroads, but the stormy economic and market conditions of the 1890s convinced many investors of the long-term viability of the new industrial concerns. Once convinced, it did not take long for an appetite to develop. The optimism that accompanied this change in perception was magnetically drawn towards the new and exciting medium of the radio. Attracted by the potential rewards, pecuniary or otherwise, a number of American scientists challenged the path Marconi had travelled. Professor Reginald Fessenden was perhaps Marconi’s most dedicated competitor, but other notable pioneers included Professor John Stone Stone, who had worked in the Bell Research Laboratories, and Lee de Forest from Western Electric’s experimental laboratory. The competition between these various parties to raise funds was particularly intense, as detailed in a fascinating exposé written by a journalist named Frank Fayant some years later.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">Professor Reginald Fessenden</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Professor Fessenden had started his career as an academic, but later fulfilled an ambition to work for one of Edison’s companies. From there, he moved to the new West Orange research laboratory to become Edison’s chief chemist. After three years of working with Edison and Arthur Kennelly, his chief electrician, Fessenden gained permission to work on Hertzian waves. Unfortunately, this coincided with the cash flow problems which forced Edison to merge Edison Electric to form Edison General Electric, under the majority ownership of Deutsche Bank and Siemens-Halske, the backers of Henry <span id="anchor_2868_92"></span>Villard.<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3279_0">⁶¹</a> Subsequently, as Villard himself suffered financial problems stemming from his involvement in the Northern Pacific Railroad, the new combination of General Electric was formed in 1892 from the merger of Edison General Electric and Thomson-Houston under the financial guidance of J. P. Morgan.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For Fessenden, the first of these mergers resulted in a cost-reduction programme that forced him to leave. He then joined a subsidiary of Westinghouse where he became involved with the ongoing research work on AC motors. The contract was short-term, and with the knowledge he had gained from his exposure to AC he found employment with a power plant company that sent him to Britain to examine the power generation work of Charles Parsons and Sebastian de Ferranti. After further career changes, Fessenden, with the assistance of George Westinghouse, obtained the position of professor of electrical engineering at what was to become the University of Pittsburgh. While at Pittsburgh, Fessenden continued his work on Hertzian waves but did so along fundamentally different lines from Marconi. While Marconi had generated a signal through use of a spark, Fessenden’s exposure to AC generation helped condition his view of Hertzian waves as high-frequency alternating currents. For Fessenden the challenge was to find a method of producing and detecting high-frequency continuous waves. The difference between spark and continuous wave technology was fundamental, as much so as the difference between the potential of the telegraph and the telephone. In an attempt to follow this challenge through to its conclusion, Fessenden accepted a position with the US Weather Bureau to further his work on wireless telegraphy.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The post at the Weather Bureau must have seemed ideal to Fessenden, given that the Bureau’s desire for transmission of weather reports coincided with his goal of providing a practical demonstration of the theoretical and practical flaws in Marconi’s work. Fessenden believed Marconi’s spark method of generating a signal was fundamentally misspecified and that the only way a clear signal could be transmitted and received was through the use of continuous waves. In this, he was to be proven correct. The continuous wave was to be a vital component in the future use of the radio for the transmission of sound. In contrast, the Morse code could only be carried by an intermittent signal. This is not to say that Fessenden foresaw this use. Like the other pioneers, his primary focus was on the replacement of the telegraph and the naval markets that were crying out for wireless information transmission. In order to pursue his hypothesis on continuous waves, Fessenden contacted GE to commission the equipment necessary to conduct practical tests. A generator capable of producing frequencies up to 100,000 cycles was requested. This had never before been achieved and was a monumental task. Despite this, GE agreed to attempt to produce such a prototype. This was eventually achieved, but the task took five arduous years of development.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the meantime, Fessenden had begun to chafe under the regime at the Weather Bureau. In 1902, he left to strike out on his own, following a disagreement regarding the commercialisation of his work. The Weather Bureau Chief contended that Fessenden had refused to comply with an order preventing him from trying to form his own private wireless company while still employed by the Weather Bureau. Fessenden counter-claimed that the Bureau chief had tried to coerce him into assigning him a half share in his patents, and had threatened to switch to Marconi equipment if Fessenden <span id="anchor_2874_97"></span>refused.<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3280_0">⁶²</a> Whatever the truth, the upshot was that Fessenden left the Bureau and, assisted by his patent attorney, obtained private funding to incorporate the National Electric Signalling Company (NESCO). His attorney found two backers, Thomas Given and Hay Walker, who were willing to commit funds to support the venture in return for a 55% share in Fessenden’s patents. These two successful businessmen were presumably drawn to the venture by the prospect of rapid profits, fuelled by the optimism of buoyant equity markets. They had no real knowledge of the medium in which they were investing, nor did they provide any management input. Fessenden was left on his own to develop the business, with periodic interventions from his backers.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The ultimate failure of the venture probably stemmed from the lack of clear initial vision about its commercial purpose. Not surprisingly, given Fessenden’s background, the venture concentrated on technical aspects first and commercial ones second. There followed a series of attempts to sell equipment to the US Navy, to establish overland stations and to build stations for transmission over water. None of these was pursued to a successful conclusion. In 1904, GE offered NESCO a contract to build an overland station. Since Given and Hay had already spent over $100,000 (over $6m) with no return, the offer from a large and reputable company must have seemed like a gift from heaven. Fessenden sent back a quotation to GE that was immediately dismissed out of hand. The final price agreed was half what he originally demanded. The real danger in the final contract was not, however, the price, but a failure clause which required repayment if successful transmission was not achieved. The failure clause later came back to haunt NESCO and in June 1906 GE withdrew from the contract. By this time, Given and Hay had invested over $500,000 (over $30m) and still had no return to show for their money. They were becoming increasingly anxious. It was not simply the technical and financial problems that put a drain on resources. Fessenden was also in frequent litigation with one of his competitors, Lee de Forest, who had been infringing his patents. The partners in the venture decided to take a new tack. If they could make their company a potential threat to one of the big existing operators, that operator might react by buying out their business.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The target that they alighted upon was the Bell Company. The threat that NESCO was to present to Bell was in transatlantic communication. To this end, stations were set up at Brant Rock in Massachusetts and Machrihanish on the west coast of Scotland. This was both a technological and financial gamble, since at the time, despite all his efforts, Marconi had met with only limited success. On the financial side Fessenden’s backers were not surprisingly anxious about the prospects of getting their investment back, let alone a meaningful return.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The technical aspects of the operation depended not only upon the theoretical work of Fessenden and the construction of the two sites, but also upon the ability of GE to deliver a high-frequency 100,000-cycle alternator. Within GE, the task had been delegated to a Swedish engineer, Ernst Alexanderson. This was work at the cutting edge of the electrical power industry. It was later to prove a vital component for the radio industry generally and remained of critical importance to GE for many years. Alexanderson’s early models were what one would have expected: expensive, large and fragile. Nevertheless, they worked and therefore allowed Fessenden to continue his work on transmission between the two continents. For some months before the delivery of the alternator, he had shown he could transmit messages of variable quality across the Atlantic. The hope was that with this new equipment a consistent and reliable signal could be produced. Unfortunately, in early December 1906, the Machrihanish station was flattened by one of the fierce ocean storms that periodically sweep over the west coast of Scotland. The fragile finances of NESCO meant that the Scottish station could not be rebuilt, and attention therefore switched from transatlantic signalling to wireless telephony.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Fessenden had been experimenting with using the alternator to produce a continuous signal that could carry the human voice. This had been stimulated almost by accident in September when the Machrihanish station had picked up voice messages from the US station. The transmission had happened by accident but was confirmed as accurate. On Christmas Eve, a demonstration of its sound-carrying capabilities was arranged by Fessenden for members of the industry press and senior industry figures, including Elihu Thomson and Arthur Kennelly of GE and G. W. Pickard of AT&amp;T’s laboratories. The following day another transmission was conducted. Christmas Day 1906 was arguably the date of the first radio broadcast. For the record, it contained a mixture of the eminent scientist singing, playing the violin and speech-making. Not surprisingly, this demonstration attracted substantial publicity and provided hope that the goal of selling the company to AT&amp;T might be realised.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For Fessenden, at last the auguries seemed to have improved. Pickard’s report to AT&amp;T headquarters was positive and emphasised both how commercial quality transmission could be achieved and the potential threats to the existing long-distance telephone system should this unfold. The threat to the long-distance telephone appeared the most potent, given the quality problems being encountered in transmissions over distances greater than 1,500 miles. The focus remained on one-to-one communication. The potential for broadcasting was still not recognised. AT&amp;T had frequently purchased patents in the past, and so the purchase of NESCO would have fitted with the company’s established practice. AT&amp;T followed up the feedback from Pickard with a report from one of the top engineers at Western Electric. The conclusion was the same, that it would make sense to acquire Fessenden’s work and merge it with AT&amp;T’s interests. The suggestion was put by AT&amp;T’s chief engineer to the company’s president.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Unfortunately for Fessenden, both these individuals fell victim to the financial crash of 1907. The new president of AT&amp;T promptly introduced a programme of financial retrenchment. Having expanded rapidly to build up its operations, AT&amp;T had a heavy debt burden, despite its strong cash flow and profit margins. As a consequence, it was dependent on bankers for fundraising. Because of the magnitude of the funds required, it had switched from Kidder to Morgan as its principal financier in the early 1900s. As part of the retrenchment, more than 10,000 employees were laid off. All non-essential research and expenditure was discarded. It was into this category that Fessenden’s work was placed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Although Fessenden continued to court AT&amp;T, it was without success. Increasingly the telephone company came to believe that the technology was sufficiently far from commercial development to mean that by the time it might be a threat, the patents would have expired. It would then be possible to obtain the technology at negligible cost. Fessenden’s autocratic and arrogant manner also left something to be desired. One must speculate that AT&amp;T’s Theodore Vail was angered by Fessenden’s offer to sell NESCO to AT&amp;T in 1910, with the accompanying threat that unless it was purchased in a short space of time NESCO would be forced to compete with the giant. The threat would have carried little weight, given the reports from AT&amp;T’s engineers on the current state of radio technology. In this they were correct, but only in the narrow sense of the threat that radio posed to wire-based telephones. They completely missed the possibility of radio as a broadcasting medium.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This proved the final throw of the dice for Fessenden. It was not long before the fragile relationship with his financial backers reached breaking point. The end of his involvement in the development of the radio came with an acrimonious split with NESCO and litigation that put the company into receivership for an extended period. In 1917, the International Radio Telegraph Company purchased the outstanding patents that represented the main assets of the company. In turn these were acquired by Westinghouse in 1920. The patent issue was important because each of the large industrial companies controlled some patents, but none had sufficient control to work without the others.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">Lee de Forest</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Lee de Forest was, like Fessenden, motivated by Marconi’s apparent early success – and by a desire to seize the mantle of ‘the father of the radio’ (awarded to the Irish-Italian by the public) for himself. De Forest had been inspired by Edison’s success. Furthermore, De Forest had received formal training in related fields at undergraduate level and through his doctoral studies. Throughout this period De Forest had clearly indicated his desire for public acclaim as one of his driving forces. Perhaps only a close second was the desire to capitalise financially from his scientific knowledge. On completing his PhD in 1899, De Forest unsuccessfully sought employment first with Nikola Tesla and then with Marconi. Failing to secure such employment, he concentrated on improving wireless reception. The work he completed on the coherer with a colleague at Western Electric (where he had gained employment at $8 a week) was incremental at best and bore a marked resemblance to that completed by Fessenden and others. This resemblance was later to stimulate litigation from Fessenden as De Forest continued his work with one of Fessenden’s ex-assistants. De Forest lost the suit and was eventually prevented from using the receiver.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">De Forest left Western Electric to pursue his work and quickly ran through a series of positions before forming a small company with support from former Yale classmates, named the Wireless Telegraph Company of America. This company tried to use the 1901 America’s Cup yacht race as a publicity mechanism, in much the same way that Marconi had done two years earlier. Thus Marconi was commissioned to cover the race for the Associated Press and De Forest for its principal rival, the Publisher’s Press Association. Unfortunately, since neither Marconi nor De Forest had the capability to select distinct signals, the two sets of equipment interfered with each other.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">If this was not bad enough, a third operator had entered the fray with the sole intent of disrupting the signals of the two companies. This third entrant was the American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company, an entity whose principal objective was to sell stock to the <span id="anchor_2898_48"></span>public.<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3281_0">⁶³</a> This company had bought old wireless patents originally taken out by Professor Dolbear and used the excitement surrounding Marconi to raise $5m ($345m). The result of the competing broadcasters was a debacle that did little to reassure the industrial community of the prospects for the new medium. It did not dampen public enthusiasm, although Marconi felt compelled to return to Britain for a new public relations effort which would renew his leadership in the public eye. For De Forest, the most pressing need was to increase the capital in his company for both personal and professional reasons. The history of these radio companies becomes somewhat complicated as various shell companies were injected into other companies and then recapitalised. Some of the history is set out below, but it is sufficient to note here that American Wireless and the majority of its subsidiaries ended up being bought by the De Forest companies, which in turn eventually ended up within United Wireless.</span> </p>
