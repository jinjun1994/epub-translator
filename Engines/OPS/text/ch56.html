<p><span class="style0">In the early part of the 19th century, Britain was the centre of industrial innovation, the pre-eminent industrial power, and (on a relative basis) the most stable society. It was therefore in Britain that the lighting industry had shown the greatest development. The Gas Act of 1847 paved the way for the gas lighting and later the electric light industries. The Act allowed for the right to excavate streets to allow the building and repair of gas pipelines. It therefore signalled official recognition of the role that private companies had played in supplying urban areas with town gas from a central source over the previous 50 years.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">In Britain, the first meaningful demonstration of the potential for gas lighting was made by a German national, Albert Winzer, who promoted its potential by lighting the Lyceum Theatre in London. Winzer, who changed his name to Winsor in order to avoid any nationalistic prejudice, was able to obtain parliamentary approval in 1812 to establish the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke Company, a joint stock, limited liability company. Winsor’s lack of engineering and financial acumen led to his replacement by Samuel Clegg. Clegg learned his expertise from William Murdoch, the chief engineer of Boulton and Watt, the company formed by steam-engine inventor James Watt. By early 1816, more than 25 miles of gas pipe had been laid. A London and Westminster employee, Friedrich Accum, wrote what was to become the bible of the industry:</span> <span class="style1">A Practical Treatise on Gas-Light</span> <span class="style0">(London, 1815). In helping disseminate the knowledge necessary to allow gas production, supply and lighting, this book greatly assisted the early development of the gas industry in the USA.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Typically the gas companies were awarded fixed-term contracts with exclusive rights to supply gas lighting. The contracts normally specified a fixed return on investment. This in turn was used to determine pricing. This regime – a monopoly with fixed pricing – had an inevitable outcome. As companies were protected within their region from competition, there was no incentive for them to increase efficiency and many soon became complacent. As the gas companies’ profitability grew, so inevitably did consumer resentment. This was reflected in the press of the time. Perhaps public opinion was paid little heed by the gas companies because of the apparent protection provided by their existing supply network. Perhaps the legislative framework sustained the belief that their domination of the municipal/commercial part of the lighting market would endure. Perhaps the companies simply did not believe that any form of electric light could replace them. Whatever the reason, it was not long before this complacent stance had to be rethought. The abuse of the gas companies’ monopoly position fostered the desire for new sources of lighting.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">In the United States, Baltimore was the first city to employ gas lighting in 1816, followed by New York in 1825. In the early years the development was heavily dependent upon knowledge and technology from Britain. As in Britain, gas lighting was only commercially viable for a small proportion of the population. In 1823 the New York Gas Light Company (NYGLC) raised the considerable sum of $200,000 ($35m) simply to begin construction of its gasworks. By 1825, gas was being produced and within eight months over 1,700 burners had been installed in residences, businesses and public buildings.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Most notable was the lighting of Broadway, which gained the name of the ‘Great White Way’ as a consequence. The cost of obtaining this reputation was considerable. The city had to purchase lampposts at $24 ($4,000) each, with an annual gas charge of $8 ($1,300). Despite the cost, gas lighting was far better than the whale-oil lights it was replacing; although demand was limited by the cost, it was still sufficient to cause a series of new gas companies to be formed. The Manhattan Gas Light Company sought the franchise for that area of New York, and this was swiftly followed by the other major urban centres of the USA. Despite this, the expense of gas lighting and the monopoly pricing policies adopted meant gas would service only a small segment of the lighting market. This was to leave the way open for kerosene to appear later and take away not only the whale-oil segment of the public lighting market but also to capture a share of the residential lighting market for the increasingly wealthy and numerous middle classes.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Competition within the gas industry was broadly restricted to areas where there was no exclusivity clause. In these areas, competition was intense and, more often than not, dangerously unprofitable. The losses in these competitive areas sometimes threatened the existence of companies that attempted to extend beyond the monopoly boundary. Within the monopoly areas, pricing was regulated by charter, but companies otherwise had freedom to operate as they saw fit. Technological advances – for example, new forms of gas production and piping – helped reduce costs, so for those with privileged monopoly positions, the returns were excellent. Most companies made some price reductions to assuage public opinion, but such was the strength of feeling against the companies that electrical light, when it finally appeared, was welcomed with open arms. The extent of the feeling towards gas pricing can be gauged by fact that in New York and Philadelphia enterprising citizens bred and trained dogs specifically to bite gas meter inspectors and prevent the meters being read. These dogs could be sold or leased to cover the appropriate meter-reading period!</span> </p>
