<h1 id="anchor_4463_0"><span class="style1">The market developed differently</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">One of the reasons there appeared a lack of excitement for Google’s new search engine was that the initial hopes of commercialisation appeared to revolve around licensing the technology to others. The prevailing wisdom was that revenue generation followed from retention of potential customers on</span> <span class="style1">your</span> <span class="style0">portal, rather than sending them elsewhere. For this reason the accepted advertising business model revolved around product placement and paid-for advertising. This was in direct contradiction to search, which was about comparison and price discovery. If search was not overwhelmingly important in its own right, there seemed to be no need to outsource the function to a third party. In fact, there was a ‘mini mania’ for a period, during which real estate on portals became critical and ‘stickiness’ the most valued attribute.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">On numerous occasions the founders of Google pointed to the inherent conflicts of interest in existing search models, where paid-for advertising could skew the results of search towards the advertiser. What Google had in its favour was the evidence both of the superior nature of its search engine and the traction it was gaining through exponential growth in users and traffic. These two features, combined with the powerful personalities of the founders, persuaded influential investors to back the venture. Through Stanford faculty member David Chilton, they were introduced to the founder of Sun Microsystems, Andy Bechtolsheim. As only a wealthy and successful individual can, Bechtolsheim backed the venture almost instantly and this set in motion a chain of events that brought in other notables from the Valley. The company ended with a $25m joint investment from Sequoia Capital and Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers at a valuation of $100m.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The ultimate pricing model solution for Google was already in train. Elsewhere, serial entrepreneur Bill Gross understood that the mass of traffic on the Internet had to be both filtered and specific to ultimately be of value to advertisers. He further understood that specific traffic could be purchased from ad networks/online banners and made available to interested parties on a price-per-click basis. The interested parties would bid on a keyword and then be rewarded by traffic with a high degree of relevance. This would initiate the volume needed to make the model operational and then search would eventually take over the provision of specific traffic. In common with existing general advertising practices, the higher the price the advertiser was willing to pay per click, the more prominent the placement they would receive.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For Internet true believers, the direct link between search results and advertising payments was anathema. However, this did not stop Bill Gross’s site GoTo.com growing rapidly. Such was its success that it was also able to syndicate its service to other companies, most notably AOL. The success of syndication in generating traffic, and hence revenues, was such there was internal concern about potential conflicts between the internal site and the syndicated sites. As a consequence GoTo.com was renamed Overture and the internal destination site was de-emphasised.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Google, on the other hand, had applied the logic of search and blended it with that of advertising and in October 2000 launched the AdWords programme. This included “the ability to fine-tune ads in real-time, post new ads instantly, monitor ad statistics, and track inventory and cost-per-day <span id="anchor_4473_48"></span>impressions”.<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4889_0">¹⁰⁴</a> (In the Google version of advertising, pop-ups and banner ads did not clutter the page and slow down results – but, more importantly, ads were ranked according to relevance rather than by the consideration paid by the advertiser.) The main drawback of advertising on Google was that the consideration was paid on ‘impressions’ rather than the more informative ‘click throughs’, which depended upon the viewer actually taking some action. The contest was therefore between a better search engine and a better advertising model.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In an attempt to put the two together, Gross met Brin and Page, but by then the stable door had been open too long and Google was not interested in partnering. Whether this was because of the undue influence of paid advertising on search results, or because Google preferred to develop its own offering, or some mixture of the two, is not particularly important now. What is important was that by 2002 AdWords incorporated a pay-per-click pricing model. This precipitated a lawsuit from Overture which was eventually settled by the time Overture had been bought by Yahoo. Google was by then established as the leader in search and search-based advertising revenues.</span> </p>
