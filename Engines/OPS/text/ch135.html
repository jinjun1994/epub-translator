<h1 id="anchor_3620_0"><span class="style1">Conclusions</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The emergence of computer technology differed from many other technologies in that it was largely funded by government. Certainly other industries had benefited from government injections of capital to accelerate development for the armed forces, but computing was fostered both in periods of peace and war. Governments required the ability to collect and analyse large volumes of data for purposes of both taxation and expenditure. In the military sphere, the field of ballistics had always been constrained by a lack of practical ability to fulfil the computational requirements. The demand for computational power from both business and government grew rapidly. Thus while the theoretical work of Babbage never made it to a practical commercial form, it was not long before others pursued the same route.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Babbage example shows that governments, just like other customers, are subject to the whims of opinion and perception. When war had to be fought, necessity became the mother of invention. During peacetime the development process proceeded at a more sedate pace. In the US, Hollerith won a major contract with the Census Bureau, and other companies such as American Arithmometer and National Cash Register began to emerge with computational products for the commercial sector. The lead enjoyed by these companies, together with some of their business practices, was to bring them into conflict with government authorities concerned with monopoly practices and the absence of sufficient competition. Although the business segments they occupied remained profitable and growing even through the difficult economic conditions of the early 1900s, their stock market performance remained relatively immune from the excitement and hype which surrounded other industries such as the telephone and the radio. Perhaps the reason lay in the scale of their business and the capital required to make entry plausible. The relatively well-defined demand profile also contributed, combined with the fact that the products by and large required precision-engineering processes which carried little mystique, with success or failure demonstrable.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The industry continued to grow steadily through to World War II, when effectively a quantum leap took place and analogue machines were superseded by their new numerical counterparts. The war removed constraints on research funding and expenditure, while at the same time bringing together the foremost scientists of the day. Research took place not only in universities and government research facilities but also within existing large corporations. The net result was that by the end of the war the underpinning provided by basic research had advanced, but more importantly the emphasis had shifted to the production of machines which provided practical assistance. After the war, the mainframe sought a commercial peacetime home.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The early phase of development therefore did not require continuous propaganda to maintain the confidence of private sector investing bodies by proving the theoretical capabilities or, second, demonstrating some form of commercial viability. It was not that these tasks did not have to be undertaken, simply that the sponsoring body was by and large the government, and the funding took place under a special set of wartime conditions. The creation of a commercial machine from the foundations of the wartime effort did not happen overnight, nor did the financial markets or the press initially seem to realise the significance of what was happening. First, in the early stages the inventors had been courting the government rather than the private sector. Second, it took some time for the technology to move to a point where costs were falling while processing power was growing. Only when valves had been replaced by transistors was the trend established and later accelerated with the introduction of semiconductors. Suddenly the size of the market was no longer limited by the level of capital expenditure required, but driven by the ability of producers to bring the cost of the machines down to within reach of a consequently increasing customer base. The impact of this expansion shows up clearly in the results of IBM, the giant of the industry.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For IBM, so lucrative was the expansion that the implications of the trend that caused it were largely ignored. As a consequence a niche was left open to be quickly and profitably filled by companies such as DEC. Ironically, even this example of a new business being created by producing smaller yet powerful machines did not immediately establish a trend. This was only to come with the advent of the personal computer. Equally, the relatively apathetic reaction to the introduction of the technology only changed when its growth prospects became clearer. When this happened, the stock market reaction was overwhelming – almost as if a dam had burst – and share prices moved to a position well in excess of that justified by the returns being earned or what could plausibly be expected.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The 20 years after the war witnessed the emergence of a brand new industry. Cumbersome computation machines had been transformed into computers. Valves were replaced by transistors and subsequently semiconductors. New companies were formed to develop the technology further. There were competitors in the existing marketplace for mainframes – a market which remained dominated by IBM. There was a new marketplace for smaller machines, which had been exploited by DEC. Finally, there was a range of companies involved in supplying components, peripherals and software. Most notable among these was Intel, which had emerged, like the majority of the semiconductor specialists, from Fairchild Semiconductor.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Compatibility was the key to the growth of competition. New, small-scale producers could only hope to enter the market if they could access the existing knowledge and product base. To do this they had to offer compatible products, otherwise customers would be unwilling to absorb the cost of switching vendor. This placed great power in the hands of the dominant supplier, which effectively set the standards for the industry. The false sense of security this created may have caused these companies to miss new opportunities and lag behind the evolution of the industry. The other ironic impact of compatibility was that the largest companies still controlled the pace of development in the industry, particularly as the design and production of microprocessors became the province of specialist companies.</span> </p>
