<h1 id="anchor_969_0"><span class="style1">The rule of law – or corruption?</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It was at this point that the vagaries of the New York legal system really began to impose themselves. Drew et al reacted by recruiting a different Supreme Court judge, who stayed all Vanderbilt’s actions and removed his appointee, Frank Work, from the Erie board. While the injunctions were passing back and forwards, Drew continued to issue stock and Vanderbilt was forced to purchase this. Drew also set aside $500,000 for ‘legal purposes’ and published his railroad superintendent’s report on the need to raise funds to upgrade the railroad. These reports were useful propaganda tools supporting the bond issue (whose true purpose was simply to drive down the share price and take capital from Vanderbilt). Eventually matters came to a head. Vanderbilt’s financial position became precarious and liquidity dried up as Drew removed $7m in cash for the stock sales he had made. Vanderbilt had Judge Barnard issue contempt orders on 11 March. With the benefit of advance notice, Drew, Fisk and Gould managed to avoid arrest by fleeing to New Jersey, carrying the $7m in cash and as much of the company’s paperwork as they could manage.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The war of injunctions was to continue through 1868, during which time the Drew group continued with both legal and physical protection, to the extent of installing cannons on the wharves near their headquarters, and receiving backup from a squad of New Jersey policemen (to augment their own armed guards). On one occasion a group of insurgents was only repelled by superior <span id="anchor_973_63"></span>numbers.<a href="ch36.html#anchor_1147_0">¹¹</a> Vanderbilt, on the other hand, survived by threatening to bring down the whole financial system if further capital was not advanced to him.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The end of the first installment of this saga came with Gould seeking the assistance of the New York state legislature in Albany. Aided by his ‘legal purposes’ fund, Gould assiduously lobbied for the legalisation – or validation – of Erie’s bond issues. Although Gould was to prevail, the state senators proved capable negotiators and the cost to Gould was more than $1m. Gould outbid Vanderbilt’s inducements to the politicians, and consequently Tweed’s cohorts swung behind him. The bill legalising the bond issues was passed with a clause prohibiting the same group from controlling both the New York Central and Erie Railroad.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This key clause meant Vanderbilt’s stock in the Erie Railroad was to all intents and purposes a burden to him. He only escaped from this sticky position when the ever-duplicitous Daniel Drew double-crossed Gould. Between them, Drew and Vanderbilt were able to organise sufficient directors to control the Erie Board and authorise a series of transactions which effectively reimbursed Vanderbilt for his loss of control. The cost to Erie was $9m in debt. Gould was left with what appeared to be an empty shell.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Having issued $20m of bonds and shares, but with no capital expenditure or improvements to show for it, the shell company was certainly not a valuable entity as it stood. Recognising the need for political patronage, Gould appointed the Tammany leader William Tweed to the board. This appointment brought with it the legal and political support that had been critical in previous battles. What followed was a repetition of past behaviour, with insider short selling, followed by short squeezes or ‘corners’. A further $20m of capital was issued to complete the work the previous bond issues had ostensibly been arranged to finance. It was followed by a shorting operation in August 1869 when Gould took his revenge upon Drew. Gould enticed him into a share shorting operation and then trapped him with a classic liquidity squeeze, thus forcing the price up.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Unlike Vanderbilt, Gould offered Drew no avenue to extricate himself. Drew tried to threaten retribution with a legal suit, but only succeeded in alerting Gould, who used the suit (from foreign investors aimed at preventing further stock issues and at appointing a receiver) to his own advantage. Through the efforts of his “favorite” judge, Judge Barnard, Gould managed to have himself appointed receiver. This was swiftly followed by a legal action for recovery of the funds Vanderbilt had received in the original settlement. Vanderbilt claimed he had never received funds from Erie, only to have Gould’s associate Jim Fisk show the press the original cheque <span id="anchor_981_106"></span>stubs.<a href="ch36.html#anchor_1148_0">¹²</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The relationship with Tweed was critical to Gould’s operations. Not only did it provide the aforementioned political and legal umbrella, it also gave him access to the New York City funds that allowed Gould, with the connivance of Tweed, to manipulate the amount of monetary liquidity in the market. “It was widely known that on certain occasions Henry H. Smith of the brokerage firm of Smith, Gould and Martin, together with Tweed, drove up to the Tenth National Bank, the Black Friday institution, in a cab, and drew their balances out, Smith alone taking $4,000,000 with him which he kept several days at home under lock and <span id="anchor_983_108"></span>key.”<a href="ch36.html#anchor_1149_0">¹³</a> As liquidity tightened, the cost of borrowing rose, pushing down the prices of stocks and commodities. This benefited Gould, who had already established short positions.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Gould gradually acquired more interests in railroads and other businesses that could not resist his overtures, due to their reliance on his transportation links. Not all these attempts were successful. His bid to acquire the newly completed Albany and Susquehanna (A&amp;S) Railroad was thwarted by its pugnacious president, Joseph Ramsay, and an emerging New York financier by the name of John Pierpoint Morgan. Ramsay countered Gould’s moves in the stock market with the assistance of Morgan, and on the ground with the assistance of his own armed party, which routed the Erie irregulars comprised of “Bowery toughs and sheriff’s deputies”. J. P. Morgan added to Ramsay’s defence by finding another home for the A&amp;S railroad and in doing so took a seat on the board.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Eventually Gould lost control of Erie, as the protective umbrella of Tweed and Tammany Hall came under fire for its manifest corruption. Combined with the murder of Fisk by his mistress’s lover, and a renewed assault by disenfranchised British stockholders, Gould was forced to extricate himself from Erie on the best possible financial terms as part of a reorganisation which installed J. P. Morgan, among others, to the Erie board. The process by which a new form of control was to be exerted was in its infancy, but was to grow quickly. Financiers had always maintained an important position through their ability to fund operations, but the time was advancing where their influence was to increase to active participation in the management of companies and, more importantly, the structure of industries.</span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">New York Central Railroad</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The New York Central Railroad of the Vanderbilts differed substantially from its Erie counterpart. The stock watering which took place at the NYC did so during its recapitalisation in the late 1860s. The problem for investors was not so much that the company was being manipulated by its principal shareholders, but that its top-line growth began to turn down sharply. From the early 1870s onwards, revenue growth averaged just 4%. In increasingly competitive conditions, margins fell and net income growth slipped to 3%. Shareholders continued to expect a full payout of net earnings. Whether this produced a reasonable total return depended very much upon the time of purchase; it certainly was not rewarding while the manipulation was occurring. As insiders, the Vanderbilts took out $50m in cash from a company whose total assets at that time amounted to some $130m.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Summarising the investment picture, revenue growth in the early years soon became pedestrian as competition from other railroads increased. Vanderbilt knew – and pointed out – that too many railroads were trying to service the same customer base. This lay behind his repeated attempts to gain control of the Erie Railroad. He was to be ultimately frustrated in this ambition, although, as the analysis of its finances demonstrate, this may well have been a blessing. Competition not only took away revenue, but directly hit margins when price wars broke out. Even when railroads were the dominant form of transport for goods and passengers, profitability remained good rather than outstanding. Later on the NYC was to find that big customers such as Standard Oil were able to dictate terms and could use their access to competing pipelines as bargaining counters. Despite the apparently commanding position of the railroads in connecting the major commercial centres in America, there were insufficient barriers to entry to protect their position.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The New York Central did at least retain a balance sheet of reasonable strength, with the debt/equity ratio never exceeding 50%. Despite this, the net income of the company, defined after taxes and interest payments, was frequently insufficient to maintain historic dividend levels and eventually the dividend was cut. The company was never in any real threat of insolvency, however, even during the price wars. Declining margins and net income growth translated into increasingly poor returns on invested capital. A mixture of competition and increased bargaining power for certain clients produced poor share price returns. Total return was largely dependent upon an unsustainable dividend. Yet the railroad was a lucrative venture for the Vanderbilts. Not only did they recover their investment with a massive stock-watering exercise at the time of the recapitalisation of the company, they also benefited from the cash flow of the dividend stream over the period. Control of the railroad also brought them other opportunities, including, it is said, a shareholding in Standard Oil. Unfortunately for the outside private investor, the returns were somewhat less handsome, with dividend payments alone to offset the falling share price. In the 80 years from 1860, it was only during the roaring bull market of the 1920s that NYC shares regained the levels seen in the early 1870s. This, too, was a temporary phenomenon that was soon rectified by the Great Crash of 1929 and its aftermath.</span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">The New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad – the Erie Railroad</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The scandals of the Erie Railroad created the legends of the ‘Robber Barons’. Drew, Fisk and Gould battled with Vanderbilt and outside investors in a saga of stock watering and disenfranchisement. The simple part of what happened can clearly be seen from the charts, which show how earnings declined while the stock was being issued. The stock issues produced neither increased earnings nor a reduction in debt. Their sole purpose was the enrichment of the Drew-Fisk-Gould cabal. For the outside investor, there could be no rational case for investing in the company during the 1860s. Despite this, the battle for control served to push the share price up from $50 to $600 in the early 1860s, before the stock watering took place in earnest and the price collapsed back to $100.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">How did the stock watering work? A simple example would be where stock was issued to the public and the proceeds were then used to purchase bonds on railroad property from one of the insider parties at a greatly inflated price. As for the operational health of the Erie Railroad, its accounts show a balance sheet that was ruined by the practices of the directors and one which, as a consequence, was in no position to be able to weather any earnings shortfall. The increase in outstanding shares does not show up clearly in reduction in the returns on either equity or total assets. The main reason for this is that the company was already making poor returns prior to the stock issuance. Reported ‘net earnings’ followed the practice of the time of being effectively operating earnings and as such were earnings before financing costs. Since the company had a relatively indebted balance sheet, interest costs were high and absorbed a substantial proportion of earnings. It must have been apparent to investors that the railroads were very sensitive to economic conditions. This might have been a positive when the economy was growing rapidly, but there was still a need for prudent capital structure, something the Erie Railroad demonstrably neither had, nor was likely to get. Shares were issued as part of the process of manipulation and the ownership battle with Vanderbilt. The proceeds of the sales were siphoned off, increasing the debt of the company. As a consequence, the company repeatedly fell into bankruptcy and had a volatile share price as a result. Such volatility based on the fear of insolvency made it easy prey for stock price manipulation. The outside investor who bought at pretty much anytime after the early 1860s had little prospect of making capital returns. Ironically, throughout the period the Erie Railroad had better revenue growth and higher operating margins than the New York Central, which only serves to emphasise the importance of an appropriate balance sheet – structured for the needs of the business rather than the perceptions of the outside world or the benefit of insiders. In the long run, there was ultimately no escape from the disciplines of cash and debt. Since the railroad was run as a stock market jobbing vehicle and paid attention to these key operating metrics only in the context of manipulating the share price, it should not be surprising that the company repeatedly flirted with complete liquidation, particularly in times of economic stress for the national economy.</span> </p>
