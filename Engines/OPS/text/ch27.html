<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For the United States, the 1800s was a time of growing international trade, emigration from Europe and technology transfer from the developed economies to the New World. Some of the technology transfer simply took the form of the skills brought by the immigrant population. However, US entrepreneurs were also visiting Europe to see what new inventions and technologies could profitably be imported. In the case of the railroads, at first the Americans simply imported the steel and the locomotives.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Later, the skills and manufacturing techniques required to build a railway also began to cross the Atlantic, leading to the creation of an independent railroad industry. While America was a new country, it combined an established economic system on the eastern seaboard, resembling that of the ‘Old Country’, and the emerging potential of the new western frontier. Together these created a whole new set of operating conditions.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the early 18th century, the transport of goods in America was a laborious and expensive process. Although a substantial network of rural roads existed, these were little more than cleared paths maintained by local communities, and could be navigated only with the forbearance of nature. The need for improvements stimulated the construction of privately and publicly financed tollroads and turnpikes. The British blockade of US ports during the War of 1812 helped to stimulate the construction of new roads, to provide new channels for the transport of goods. The real impetus only came after the end of the war, as economic conditions improved. The construction of turnpikes accelerated. By 1821, more than 6,000 miles of new roads had been authorised.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The turnpikes, though, were not a financial success. They were financed in the main by companies set up for the purpose, which raised funds from both public subscription and from governmental bodies. The economics of operation meant that many of them struggled to earn sufficient revenue to cover their maintenance costs, let alone provide a reasonable return on capital. The principal problem was that any meaningful charge for the bulk transportation of low-cost goods made using the road prohibitively expensive for the transporter. Equally important was how difficult it was to collect the charges. Users were quite willing to wait until nightfall before passing through the toll stations, or to circumnavigate them completely.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The toll roads’ financial failure can be measured by the fact that even in the most successful state for turnpikes, fewer than six out of a total of 230 paid satisfactory returns to <span id="anchor_834_34"></span>investors.<a href="ch36.html#anchor_1140_0">⁴</a> So far as canals were concerned, the development of an inland waterway system had lagged behind what had been witnessed in Britain. The principal reasons were the absence of capital to fund construction and a shortage of engineering skills to build them. Just as important was the lack of evidence from the few canals that had been built that they represented a viable financial proposition. It was against this background that the Erie Canal was built. The longest canal in America prior to the Erie had stretched a grand total of 28 miles. Authorised in 1817 by the New York legislature, the Erie Canal was to stretch over 350 miles, from Albany through wilderness to Buffalo on Lake Erie. Funded by the state, the Erie Canal proved a resounding success. Having cost roughly $7.5m ($1.3bn) to construct, it was soon earning tolls of $500,000–$750,000 a year (over $100m) and worrying about congestion on the waterway.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The success of the Erie Canal spurred a huge level of construction throughout America. No longer were investors or government bodies frightened by the financial consequences. Between 1816 and 1860, over $200m ($32bn) was poured into canal construction. Private investors were bolstered by the attitude of the states and the federal government, which were willing to subscribe to the new ventures and in some cases accounted for the majority of the invested funds. Unfortunately for all these investors, few canals ultimately proved profitable. The boom caused construction costs to rise, allowed some less-than-competent companies to be floated, and – most importantly – ignored the basic economics of many routes. The profitable canals enabled coal and other bulk goods to be transported quickly between supplier source and customer. They had the ability to carry relatively heavy tonnage, few locks, and efficient collection and distribution at either end. The railroad feeders at the ends of the canals were often unable to cope with the volume of goods, creating bottlenecks and delays.</span> </p>

<h2><span class="style1">No match for the railroads</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">All these were issues for the canals, but their demise was ultimately due to their inability to compete with the railroads. The year the Erie Canal was completed in America also saw the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway in Britain. While few canals were built in Britain after the 1830s, in America the major building took place during that decade and extended into the 1840s – by which time the economic superiority of the railroad should have been obvious. Perhaps the spirit of the time was such that the threat of the railroad was ignored – although it could not have been through ignorance. America had also embraced the railroad, to the extent that by 1840 there was more operational track in the US than there was in Europe.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the period to 1850, roughly $372m (over $50bn) had been invested in the railroads, but in the seven years to 1857 a further $600m (over $80bn) was invested – a figure</span> <span class="style1">three times</span> <span class="style0">that which had been sunk into canals over their lifetime. The surge in capital for the US railroads involved funding from outside of America on an unprecedented scale, together with the creation of an industry which attracted many of the most famous (or notorious!) corporate figures of 19th-century America.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">While the development of the American railroads followed a similar pattern to their counterparts in Britain, there were significant differences. Britain was in many ways the world’s economic superpower, and America was an emerging market. In Britain there was an established legal and governmental system; in America, the delineation of the legal province of the individual states and central government was in many cases unclear. In America, land on which to lay track was readily available; in Britain it often had to be secured against entrenched opposition. The final and most notable difference was that, as the major financial centre of the world, Britain was an exporter of capital – and, as a developing market, America was an importer.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The early American railroads were relatively short lines linking existing urban centres. As such, finding capital for them was not too difficult and was normally achieved within the locality being served. As the length of the railroads increased, so did the funding requirements. Frequently, the railroads would find the seed capital locally so that construction could begin, before going to Europe – and Britain in particular – for additional capital.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the early years, British investors were unwilling to accept railroad stock directly, preferring to purchase state bonds. In order to raise funds, the railroads exchanged bonds with the state and then sold the state bonds to British investors. The trade in these bonds was dominated at first by existing finance houses, most notably Baring Brothers and N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons. However, it was not long before the American importers such as George Peabody branched into the merchant banking and investment business, and his company was eventually passed to Junius Morgan. The other major form of funding came in the shape of barter payment for the iron rails being exported to America. These were almost entirely supplied from Britain until the 1840s, when the boom in British railway construction diverted supply to the home market and encouraged US domestic production. At one time, as much as half of the capital in American railroads owned by Britons was a consequence of funding the export of the rails themselves.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For the scion of the House of Morgan, the early funding of American expansion proved difficult. Although Peabody had established a thriving business, it was a period of great uncertainty. Lucrative returns had been earned selling American railroad stocks; demand for such stock soared after the food shortages brought on by the Crimean War. When the war ended and prices fell, however, Morgan found himself heavily overextended. He would have become insolvent if he had not been bailed out by the Bank of England through Barings. Morgan was later to catapult his company forward with a loan to the French government during the Franco-Prussian War. US companies such as Morgan, Cooke and Brown Brothers were now making inroads into the London market, hitherto the preserve of European financiers. This was important, as these groups were the ones to which many shareholders would turn during the increasingly difficult times that were to follow for British investors in American railroads.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The efficiency and capacity advantages which had been demonstrated in Britain’s railways were also evident in America. The buildup in canal freight that had accompanied the economic expansion of the American network was abruptly reversed as railroads encroached on the traffic. From the post-Civil War period onwards, the canals witnessed a steady decline in traffic.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The process of capital raising and investment changed after the US Civil War, as investors increasingly sought participation in the growth of the railroads. The preference shifted away from bonds with fixed-interest payments towards common shares or bonds convertible into common shares. During the 1840s the US states had suspended interest payments, and some investors had long memories. This, together with recent failures in certain railroads, kept investors sufficiently wary that some form of interest payment was required, particularly during the construction phase. Hence convertible bonds became the favoured form of investment vehicle.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Equally, while the British investors were once more willing to invest in railroads and in US stock, they tended to concentrate on ‘lower risk’ enterprises. Typically, this meant railroads that had land mortgages and connected strategically important <span id="anchor_862_38"></span>centres.<a href="ch36.html#anchor_1141_0">⁵</a> The demand for convertible securities seemed to provide added security (by reason of the dividend payment), but this was to have an unintended side effect. It seemed ideal in principle that convertibles could be issued to finance construction and then, once the railroad was completed and the risk profile accordingly reduced, be converted into equity to give full participation in the growth. Later, however, unscrupulous operators were to discover that this provided the perfect backdoor route to issue new equity. It was a tool deployed to great effect by Jay Gould and his cohorts during the scandal of the battles over the Erie Railroad.</span> </p>
