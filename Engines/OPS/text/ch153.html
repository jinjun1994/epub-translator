<p><span class="style1">The chapter is split into four sections and includes updated material to reflect the changes which have taken place since the first edition of the book was published. Part 1 outlines the origins and early development of the Internet. Part 2 considers its commercialisation through case histories of the key companies that emerged in its early history. Part 3 studies the associated stock market reaction, then the extraordinary bubble that ensued – and its aftermath. The final section looks at the wider impact of the Internet and how it may evolve in the future. This theme is also developed further in the final chapter.</span> </p>
