<h1 id="anchor_3449_0"><span class="style1">The legacy of Bletchley Park</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In Britain, efforts centred on Bletchley Park, nominally the Post Office Research Station, but in reality the top-secret home of the code-breaking team headed by the mathematician Alan Turing. The task set for Turing was to construct a machine able to decode messages sent by the German Enigma coding equipment. Turing was supplied with an outline of Enigma by a Jewish Polish engineer who had worked in an Enigma assembly plant and who had been smuggled out of Warsaw by the French intelligence service. While Turing therefore had an outline of how Enigma worked, he had to work out how to find the ‘cipher key’ which would allow conversion of the encrypted message back into German.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">What Turing developed was the basic algorithms of artificial intelligence, which would allow the shortcuts necessary to narrow down the many billions of possible outcomes to a manageable number which could then be inspected – thus allowing the key to be found. With a model of the Enigma machine, artificial intelligence techniques and a physically huge electromechanical set of processing equipment, the team at Bletchley was able to decipher the German Enigma messages. Technology would not stand still, though, and Turing’s team soon had to contend with an improved German ciphering system three times the size and complexity of the initial version. The first iteration of the British response was the Colossus, which comprised nearly 2,000 vacuum valves. The purpose of the Colossus was to assist in preparing a subset of potential outcomes which could then be processed further to find the underlying message. Arguably, although the British Official Secrets Acts makes the assertion difficult to sustain, Colossus represented the world’s first electronic computer.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Just as efforts in Britain concentrated on increased computational power for the war effort, so too did Turing’s equivalent in Germany. Konrad Zuse had also built a computational machine utilising relays and vacuum tubes. Unlike Turing’s efforts, Zuse’s came to naught as a result of Allied bombing in 1944. But the wartime efforts in Britain were mirrored and eventually surpassed in America. One reason might have been Winston Churchill’s mistaken view on the need for secrecy after the war, which led to much of Bletchley Park’s code-breaking equipment being, as one novelist later put it, broken up into pieces “no bigger than the size of a man’s <span id="anchor_3455_108"></span>hand”.<a href="ch135.html#anchor_3642_0">⁷⁹</a> Progress in Britain was retarded as a result, but in America the scientific community had been accelerating efforts in the field of computation even before Churchill’s mistaken policy. No doubt the diversion of two Colossus machines by the secret service in partial repayment for US armaments during the war also helped. The use of punched cards and the organisation of computational astronomical work by Comrie in Britain had been observed by the eminent Harvard astronomer Professor H. Brown and later by Wallace Eckert. Eckert was to join the staff at Columbia University where a strong relationship already existed with IBM through donations from Thomas Watson. This relationship would allow Columbia to develop its computing expertise in conjunction with IBM after the war, but during the immediate pre-war period the main thrust of the company’s academic efforts focused on Harvard and the construction of what became known as Harvard Mark I. Also known as the IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, the machine began life in 1936 and was finally completed in 1943.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The team at Harvard was headed by Howard Aiken, who had gravitated towards numerical machines as an alternative to the precision-engineered but limited analogue incumbents. In his quest to solve these problems, Aiken came across the work of Babbage and determined to follow it to its logical conclusion. He was able to persuade IBM to adopt the project with initial funding of $15,000 ($330,000), soon raised to $100,000 ($2m). Just as importantly, IBM assigned experienced senior research staff to the project, including, as head, Clair Lake who had been responsible for IBM’s first printing tabulator in 1919. The ASSC or Harvard I was completed in 1943 and announced with a fanfare on 7 August 1944. The size of the machine and its automatic nature captured the public imagination despite the fact that in terms of operational speed it represented an incremental advance rather than a quantum leap. This was a consequence of the components used in its construction, most notably the use of electrical relays. The quantum leap was to come from the abandonment of slow mechanical relays and their replacement with vacuum tubes.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The other item of note is that Aiken studiously ignored the massive contribution made by IBM, not just in terms of funding, but more importantly their scientists who had brought the initial concept to a working physical machine. Apparently this stemmed from a disagreement between Watson and Aiken over the ‘look’ of the machine, with Watson desiring something more marketing friendly than an untidy electrical engine. Watson won in the sense that a shiny cover was put on the machine, but in turn Aiken refused to attribute due credit to IBM’s contribution. In a technological sense the Harvard Mark I did represent a milestone, but more as a symbol of the ending of one period than the beginning of a new one.</span> </p>
