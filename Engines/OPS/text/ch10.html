<p><span class="style0">The final chapter of the book outlines my general observations about the nature of technological change, its impact on financial markets and the roots of speculative mania. I use a simple model to formalise the interaction between a new technology and the markets, and assess the Internet bubble and what has happened since against that framework. I conclude with some further thoughts about the short-, medium- and longer-term impact of recent developments.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">I was fortunate in my early career in investment management to be able to spend time with Sir John Templeton, one of the greatest professional investors of the 20th century. A consistent theme from Sir John was that the study of past financial history can be a rich source of inspiration and guidance for investors. A historical perspective always underpinned his own impressive achievements as an investor. One of his famous quotes was that, “The four most expensive words in the English language are ‘This time it’s different’ ”. By definition, this means understanding what has gone before.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">As Mark Twain said, history does not repeat itself exactly, but it rhymes. This book is an attempt to capture some of the lines that many investors have had to relearn for themselves over the years. It is fair to say that professional investors are often just as blameworthy as private investors for their failings during times of speculative mania. It is never too late to relearn the important lessons of the past.</span> </p>
