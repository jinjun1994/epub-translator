<h1 id="anchor_3115_0"><span class="style1">Commercial spin-offs from the radio</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The main commercial spin-off from the development of the radio was the triode or audion invented by De Forest. Like all major inventions it was surrounded by controversy and would be the subject of repeated litigation and conjecture as to who could claim to be its true ‘inventor’. The basic position was that Fleming had invented the diode, drawing on his theoretical knowledge and his background and experience with Edison. The diode markedly improved reception and De Forest then produced the triode, or audion, as an incremental improvement to the same purpose.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Perhaps the matter would have rested there, had it not been the case that the triode had attributes making it much more than an incremental improvement to the receiver. While this was not conclusive, history suggests that De Forest recognised the triode’s amplification properties but failed to see the potential applications that were available if this property could be developed and harnessed. The patent rights to the triode or audion had followed De Forest and his chequered financial history. They thus resided not in the United Wireless Company purchased by Marconi, but in the financially troubled Radio Telephone Company. This company also held some of the ex-Bell scientist John Stone Stone’s patents, which had been purchased by De Forest from his friend for the company.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The relationship with Stone was important for two reasons. First, Stone’s background in the telephone industry made him acutely aware of the desperate need for amplification of signals for long-distance calls. Second, although he had been fired from AT&amp;T in 1899, Stone remained a respected figure within the company and continued to have influential contacts at its top levels. For Stone, the properties of the audion made him immediately consider it a potential solution to the telephone industry’s principal technological problem. The conversations between Stone and De Forest would lead to contact with AT&amp;T and a trial to determine whether the audion could be used to boost long-distance signals and act as a ‘repeater’. Although the initial work did not quickly reach a successful conclusion, it was sufficient to lead AT&amp;T down the path of acquiring the audion patents from De Forest. This it did in stages, as it became more convinced of the prospects for the improved equipment. Initially, in 1913, it spent $50,000 ($2.5m) for the exclusive rights to the audion for non-wireless telegraphy. Later it extended its access to include its use on a non-exclusive basis in the wireless area for a further $90,000 ($3.7m), and finally the exclusive rights for $250,000 ($10m) in 1917. Despite all the troubles De Forest had faced – ranging from bankrupt companies to allegations of fraud – he could again afford the trappings of wealth.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For AT&amp;T, the transaction would allow the groundwork upon which to build the vitally important ‘repeater’. It also allowed AT&amp;T to become the first to transmit a voice over the Atlantic in 1915, using the technology embodied in the audion and continuous-wave technology. At this point, the conflict between Fleming’s diode patents and De Forest’s triode version re-asserted itself. The litigation instigated by Marconi for patent infringement would eventually result in a stalemate. It was held that the triode (or audion)</span> <span class="style1">did</span> <span class="style0">impinge on Fleming’s patent, but at the same time Fleming’s patent did not anticipate the triode. In other words, neither side could produce their triode without the authorisation of the other. The eventual resolution of this difficulty would lead to the creation of an entire new company, and eventually a new industry.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">While the triode or audion became an extremely important part of the telephone business, its development by AT&amp;T was not overly threatening to Marconi given the Fleming patent. What would prove substantially more damaging was the delay in the company’s research into continuous-wave signals. Fessenden had shown the superiority of continuous waves but had never progressed to a practical and commercial demonstration. This was to be achieved by Cyril Elwell, an Australian immigrant to California. Elwell studied at Stanford University, where he investigated the potential of the wireless system. This convinced him of the validity of Fessenden’s opinion on problems of spark technology.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Elwell had experience in high-frequency oscillators and knowledge of the electric arc, and he believed he saw a practical solution. This involved raising funds to purchase the North American rights to the ‘oscillating arc’, designed by Valdemar Poulsen in Denmark. Arc technology had been developed in combination with the ill-fated venture into arc lighting. This had given rise to the work of Poulsen, who was able to show a small working model of a radio capable of transmitting the human voice. Elwell had to commit to a package of phased payments totalling $450,000 ($25m) to obtain the rights to the Poulsen-Pedersen system and this was funded by recourse to his contacts at the Faculty of Stanford and through the selling of shares to the public.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">On his return to California, Elwell formed the Poulsen Wireless Telegraph Company. The initial years of the company were a qualified success – it managed to stay in business, but only by selling sufficient shares to make the payments to Copenhagen. To reach commercial viability, the company required sufficient funds to achieve critical mass in terms of network size.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This was helped by the involvement of a San Francisco banker named Beach Thompson, who injected further capital and reorganised the company into two components: the Poulsen Wireless Company and the Wireless Development company, later the Federal Telegraph Company. The Federal Telegraph Company was quickly to go head to head with the American Marconi Company. Although Elwell was to leave the company after a disagreement over its strategic direction, Federal was in a position to seriously challenge the Marconi equipment through its use of continuous waves. After Elwell’s departure the scientific staffing at Federal included De Forest, who had fled to the West Coast to avoid the repercussions of some of his previous activities, and Leonard Fuller who had previously worked at NESCO. The Federal Telegraph Company was able to make rapid inroads into the growing market for radio communications. Important as its technology was, it was also assisted by the conflict in Europe and the demands of the US Navy to have complete control over the maritime communications network.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The rationale of the US Navy was no different from that which emanated from the military arm of all governments. Communication could not be left in the control of third-party nations. Britain, through its dominion of Singapore and Malaysia, had control over the supply of gutta-percha, without which cables at the time could not be insulated. If this was not bad enough, the American Marconi subsidiary had also taken over the assets of the United Wireless Company, giving it a near-dominant market share in merchant shipping radio. Purchasing equipment from US-based Federal therefore carried with it the potential for better transmission – and was (arguably) in the national interest. In 1913 Federal received the first in a series of US Navy contracts. Federal’s threat to Marconi was evident in Marconi’s attempts to first enter into a joint venture and then subsequently acquire the company. The attempted acquisition was only frustrated by the US government stepping in and buying the company for the navy in order to avoid it falling into Marconi’s hands. (It later unfolded that of the $1.6m purchase price, over a quarter had ended up directly in the hands of the recently appointed chairman and his associates without the knowledge of his fellow Federal board directors.)</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Although Marconi was thus thwarted in his overtures to Federal, he had other irons in the fire. The high frequency alternator that the Swede Ernst Alexanderson had built for Fessenden had given way to further work in this area at GE. By 1915 Marconi desperately needed continuous-wave technology and negotiations began with the GE research department for its supply. The negotiating process would prove a tortuous one. At the time Marconi’s financial resources were limited by the war, but more than that, the company was seeking to preserve its position by way of an exclusive contract. GE was being asked to build a machine beyond what it had accomplished thus far, and was being asked to give away control of the product it was creating. That the discussions took place over an extended period simply reflected the size of the two companies and the significance of the product being discussed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">After a number of years the discussions were moving closer to a conclusion, but the role of national interest was soon to intrude. Marconi’s history and negotiating position over exclusivity was an issue not just with the US Navy. Other governments had also made representations over their potential inability to gain supply from GE if an exclusive deal was signed with Marconi. Reacting to these pressures, the US government and navy pursued a more radical solution: the removal of foreign ownership and the creation of a new American radio company.</span> </p>
