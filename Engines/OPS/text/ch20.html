<h1 id="anchor_668_0"><span class="style1">Optimism and gearing</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The behaviour of the railway stocks exhibited some ominous similarities to the mining stocks of 20 years earlier. It was not just the optimistic basis on which many schemes were promoted. Like the mining stocks, the railway stocks were highly geared instruments. Investors made an initial scrip payment of 5%, with an obligation to provide further funding in the future. If the company’s future prospects were well regarded, as they usually were at the time, the scrip would trade at a premium to its issue price. The implied gearing in the scrips – for a 5% scrip, this was 20 times – was similar to the level of gearing in many modern-day traded options. This gearing added to the risks in an investment whose fundamentals were already being put at risk by the inexorable laws of supply and demand. As figure 1.3 shows, movements in the railway share price index were closely matched by increases in the supply of new issues.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The early railways were successful commercial ventures but their share prices were soon raised to unrealistic levels by the inflated optimism of investors. This optimism was to prove unsustainable. As with Nasdaq in 1999–2000, it led to share prices being bid up to levels that far exceeded the level of returns that the shares could possibly deliver on any rational assessment of their value. The first railways to be built enjoyed what today would be called ‘first-mover advantage’, but one of the clearest lessons of corporate and investment history is that without some barrier to entry, first-mover advantage can be swiftly lost. Moreover, when capital is freely available, competition can arise even when there is no apparent sustainable commercial case for it, creating an environment in which returns are forced down for an entire industry or sector.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This is certainly what happened with the railways. The impact of the vast amount of capital which was invested in British railways, and culminated in the great railway mania of the 1840s, can be seen in figure 1.3. This shows both the rapid rise in share prices in the years before 1845 and the huge influx of new capital that this stimulated. It is not that the new technology was not demonstrably a success. Investors could see for themselves the very real benefits, such as new products and travel opportunities, that the new technology created. Not only was it part of a new era, it also appeared profitable. The dividends that the railway companies paid provided a return that was often three times greater than that available from Consols (the government bonds of the time). Dividends of 10% and a rising share price combined to create an environment in which it was possible to suspend disbelief, at least for a while.</span> </p>
