<h1 id="anchor_4403_0"><span class="style1">The Yahoo story</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The emergence of the World Wide Web brought with it a decentralised growth in information provision, in which links no longer followed hierarchical lines and instead sought to mirror more intuitive human thought processes. At least this was the original conception. The benefit of such a system was its ability to easily move through and between related documents. It avoided the constant need to reference back through hierarchical systems to find linked documents. The downside was that, in the absence of a hierarchy, finding specific pieces of information became a Herculean task. Hypertext could not simply replace the age-old library systems of cataloguing information. What it</span> <span class="style1">could</span> <span class="style0">do was provide a new and extremely powerful tool in accessing information once the correct starting point had been found. The World Wide Web provided the opportunity for masses of information to be accessed, but still lacked tools to find a way through the increasing morass. This was not immediately obvious in the very early stages, as available information was relatively eclectic, reflecting the predilections of the first users, who typically came from an academic or technical background. Equally, as there was no apparent commercial potential, few outside agencies had any interest in developing tools to assist information retrieval. As a consequence, the development of such tools emerged from individuals with a personal interest in the area. Two such individuals were engaged in postgraduate research work at Stanford University, but with a consuming interest in the Internet.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In mid-1994 Jerry Yang and David Filo were spending inordinate amounts of time surfing the emerging Web. Part of this surfing involved building a list of hyperlinks to Internet sites which they classified by subject. The classification system was a traditional hierarchical one that reflected the personalities and interests of the compilers. The system carried a number of different names, ranging from ‘Jerry’s Fast Track to Mosaic’ to ‘Jerry and Dave’s Guide to the World Wide Web’. Eventually they settled on the name ‘Yahoo!’, which was subsequently underpinned by the somewhat contorted explanation: ‘Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle’. As the classification system grew, it quickly became apparent that simply being presented with all the classifications left too laborious a task for users to sift and find what they were interested in. To simplify the process, Yang and Filo added keyword software that allowed users to search for keywords contained in hyperlinks. Suddenly there was a powerful tool for finding information on the burgeoning Web. Yang and Filo’s website was receiving more than 100,000 page views a day in <span id="anchor_4407_179"></span>1994.<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4885_0">¹⁰⁰</a> Simultaneously, the venture capital industry was beginning to wake up to the possibilities of the Internet and some interest was expressed in the work being conducted by Yang and Filo. Companies such as Netscape and AOL also initiated contact with the pair and each made an offer of $1m for the site.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Netscape’s interest was sufficiently strong that in 1995 Marc Andreessen convinced Yang and Filo to move their site to be housed on Netscape equipment. Eventually the pair faced a decision of whether to accept one of the acquisition offers or to take the funding being offered by Sequoia Capital. Much to Andreessen’s chagrin, Sequoia’s offer was accepted. As a consequence, Yahoo was ejected from Netscape’s premises. Netscape did, however, retain the link to the Yahoo site and it was to be some time before Netscape woke up to the fact that this link itself had a value as it directed customers to Yahoo free of charge. The initial valuation implied in Sequoia’s funding was $4m.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Subsequent funds were raised from selling a limited amount of shares to Softbank of Japan, and by this time Yahoo had appointed professional management in the form of Tim Koogle and been successful in raising advertising revenues. In April 1996 the stock went public, priced at $13, raising just over $30m. Although the stock moved sharply upwards after the IPO, within a relatively short period it had returned to the IPO price, earning it the sobriquet ‘Yet Another Highly Overpriced Offering’ from the press. This was to prove the bottom. From there, the share price moved not just upwards but out of sight. The question for the future was the extent to which the company’s proprietary information, extensive classification system and management ability would be able to act as a barrier to entry and protect its advertising revenue stream.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">Yahoo</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The financial history of Yahoo was so short at the time of this book’s previous edition in 2001 that it was difficult to say then whether it displayed the same financial characteristics as earlier technology companies. Companies such as Marconi waited a long time for profits to appear, but when they did, they rose sharply – reflecting the impact of rapid growth in usage on an asset base the cost of which was largely sunk. Unlike Marconi, Yahoo never had large sunk costs, meaning that its profit ratios looked exceptional from an early stage. The downside was that without sunk costs, barriers to entry were low, making the preservation and strengthening of the brand the most vital competitive weapon that the company could deploy. It was obvious that, as with all brand names, substantial expenditure would be needed to maintain its value, since at some point well-funded established companies would undoubtedly renew their assault. Given that it had a strong balance sheet, Yahoo was never at risk of losing its position overnight, and certainly not as a result of the kind of cash flow pressures that many other early movers in a new technology had to face.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">For many analysts, being cash-generative meant that Yahoo could be valued with the help of discounted cash flow techniques. Since the valuation looked stretched on that basis, in order to justify the share price it was necessary to push out the time horizon over which cash flows were discounted. Discounting cash flow over 15 years, however unrealistic, was not uncommon. The problem was that with a market capitalisation in excess of $100bn at its peak, and sales revenues of less than $1bn, no fundamental valuation technique at the time could arrive at a positive answer. This is not to say that Yahoo was an unsuccessful or poorly managed company. The opposite was the case. It was, after all, one of the few companies which at the height of the bubble produced both positive cash flow and profits.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">No doubt in part for that very reason, from 2002 to 2005 the share price of Yahoo rose by 300%, but that was as far as the company could take its market valuation. Since then the history has been one of struggle to compete against the new competitor Google. The latter was able to take advantage of the absence of financial barriers to entry that existed while Web search was still nascent. This rapidly eroded any hopes Yahoo might have had of sustaining a market leadership position and the accompanying protection that scale would have provided. Many opinions have been offered to explain why Google was able to supplant Yahoo in the search engine space. For some it is about the systems architecture of Yahoo, which powered its early rapid expansion but has since been too inflexible to allow the company to adapt as quickly. For others it is about the brand management. The most persuasive evidence suggests that Yahoo lost ground by paying insufficient attention to the development of search – and search advertising – technology, and then proved unable to create, or buy in and integrate, a competitive offering.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">It was not that management failed to perceive the threat, as the purchases of Inktomi (search) and Overture (search advertising) demonstrated. However, the acquisitions took too long to integrate and the technology took longer to upgrade than was necessary to maintain parity with Google. A series of changes in the management were made, but each iteration proved unable to resuscitate the company, and in 2017 the Internet businesses were acquired by Verizon, with the rump of the business, including its valuable shareholdings in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, being retained by the successor company Altaba. On a like-for-like basis the value of Yahoo’s search business had diminished by more than 95% from its bubble peak, albeit the value of the two minority investments mitigated the decline significantly.</span> </p>

<div class="img_container"><img src="../images/image_11.jpg" style="width:236px;height:2px;" alt="image_11.jpg" /></div>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Unfortunately for the company, the view that it was protected by barriers to entry proved to be misplaced. Faced with a new and fierce competitor in the shape of Google, Yahoo slowly but surely lost its market leadership to a more determined rival. Depending upon their background, commentators have ascribed the decline of Yahoo to a number of different factors. For some it was down to branding, with a view that “Yahoo has lacked a definitive brand purpose”, while “Google has mastered brand strategy and <span id="anchor_4437_86"></span>management”.<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4886_0">¹⁰¹</a> For others it was about the design of infrastructure: Yahoo rapidly increased capacity through adding NetApp storage devices, whereas Google developed its Google File System using “commodity servers to support a flexible and resilient architecture that could solve scalability and accelerating the future rollout of a wide range of web-scale applications, from maps to cloud <span id="anchor_4437_142"></span>storage”.<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4887_0">¹⁰²</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The most likely explanation is also the simplest. From the start, Google was entirely focused on creating the fastest and most accurate search engine. Yahoo was not. As a consequence, Google was able to leapfrog Yahoo to such an extent that Yahoo sought to purchase its rival, only to baulk at the potential $5bn price. Instead it decided to buy in search and search advertising technology. In abstract, the purchase of search engine company Inktomi (for $257m) and the search advertising company Overture (for $1.4bn) might well have seemed the more sensible alternative. However, the process of integrating these two acquisitions proved troublesome, riven by internal politics and compromised by external customer relations, most notably those with Microsoft, now awake to the potential power of search and an important client of Overture.</span> </p>
