<p><span class="style0">There followed a sustained fight by the new company to hold its ground against the massive Western Union. Agents were reminded of Bell’s patent, contracts were restricted to five years and agents were granted franchises for intra-city rights only, Bell retaining the inter-city traffic rights. This was the embryonic design for a federal telephone system. Some may have seen this as a futile challenge to the hegemony of Western Union. For a while, the Bell Telephone Company certainly slipped behind in both market penetration and equipment manufacturing. These low expectations were reflected in the performance of the share price, which by late 1879 stood at $50, little higher than the price at which the shares had been initially offered.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The pretrial depositions for the patent infringement lawsuit took place in April 1879. The case continued until November of that year. Testimony was taken from Bell, who proved to be a first-class witness, and Gray, whose evidence was undermined by his letter of acknowledgement to Bell. Western Union had hoped that its strength as a company would see it to victory, but even its own chief electrical expert concluded after exhaustive study that any working telephone would have to incorporate the principles embodied in Bell’s patent. Western Union was meanwhile coming under concerted attack once more from Jay Gould, this time through American Union. The twin distractions of combatting Gould and the gloomy prognosis for the legal case influenced Western Union to negotiate a settlement with Bell. The head lawyer of Western Union recognised that Bell would undoubtedly win. The agreement Western Union negotiated with the Bell Telephone Company reaffirmed Bell’s patent and introduced a non-compete clause, excluding Bell from the telegraph business and Western Union from telephones. The parties also agreed that Bell would purchase the Western Union telephone system and pay them a royalty of 20 cents on all telephone rentals. At a stroke, the deal transformed Bell from a fledgling operator to a major company with more than 50,000 subscribers in more than 50 cities. The stock market understood this quickly and the company’s share price reacted accordingly, soaring from $50 to $300 in a matter of weeks, and to $500 by the end of 1879.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The effect of the Western Union agreement was to propel the telephone to a different level of development and give the Bell Telephone Company access to America’s most comprehensive wire network. However, this was only the first stage in its commercial deployment. Shortly after the agreement with Western Union was reached, the Bell Telephone Company was recapitalised at $6m ($0.5bn) and renamed the American Bell Telephone Company. This enabled the Bell company to buy Western Electric and merge it with its own equipment-producing subsidiary. Given that Western Electric was to end up as AT&amp;T’s manufacturing arm, it is ironic that the company was founded by Bell’s rival Elisha Gray and E. M. Barton to produce telephone equipment for Western Union. After the court settlement, this equipment was deemed an infringement of the patent and the way was thus paved for American Bell to acquire control in late 1881. As a footnote, Gray’s own partner Barton commented: “Of all the men who didn’t invent the telephone, Gray was the nearest.”</span> </p>
