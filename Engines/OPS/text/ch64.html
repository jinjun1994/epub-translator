<p><span class="style0">Claims and counterclaims passed back and forward in the press. Since the probability of a successful outcome was unknown, investors became affected by prevailing sentiment. In the early days, the extent to which incandescent lighting could actually be achieved – let alone compete with electric arc or gas lighting – could not have provided a backdrop of financial security. Such were the mood shifts that in 1879 the directors of the Light Company were joking in black humour as to whether or not they would be able to find anyone gullible enough upon whom they could unload their <span id="anchor_1695_99"></span>stock.<a href="ch68.html#anchor_1891_0">³⁹</a> The history of the movements in the share price of the Edison Electric Light Company is somewhat patchy; it was not a heavily traded security and the available information comes only from records of private transactions. The picture appears to be one where the initial excitement surrounding Edison’s progress lifted the shares from a low of under $200 to well over $3,000, a level which was not sustained for any meaningful time. The share price then moved sharply back down as the realities of the timescale of development and profitable implementation became clearer.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">So far as the share price of gas companies was concerned, the reaction was almost the mirror image. The initial share price response was collapse. Editorials in the major newspapers forecast the imminent demise of the gas industry and share prices fell precipitously. The Manhattan Gas Light Company share price fell by over 20%, that of the Metropolitan by 25%, and the Harlem Gas Light Company by 45% over a period of days.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">These falls, which happened in response to Edison’s announcements, were only a small part of a bigger picture. The share price chart of Manhattan Gas shows how the market crash of 1873 caused a share price decline before a strong recovery. Arguably the strength of the gas company’s monopoly position helped the share price as part of a ‘flight to quality’ after the crash. Not much later, the positive sentiment surrounding arc lighting began to have an effect, and the share price of Manhattan Gas began to slip in both absolute and relative terms.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Eventually the gas companies were forced to react to the development of electrical light by merging. In 1884, the New York, Manhattan, Metropolitan, Knickerbocker and Harlem Gas Companies merged to form the Consolidated Gas Company of New York. Later, many of the gas and electrical distribution companies merged to try and avoid further competition. The San Francisco-based Pacific Gas and Electric Company was one example, but many others can be found from Cincinnati to Chicago. The merger period caused some excitement before share prices fell again. A slight recovery (relative to market movements) then followed, but the peaks recorded before the advent of electric light were never again reached. This was the longer-term picture; it does scant justice to the ebb and flow of opinion on the future prospects for the incandescent lamp. The gas companies would lose their main market to electricity. They were, however, in a position to diversify away from lighting where they were at a technological disadvantage, and into heating and cooking where the position was a much more even one. Thus the massive infrastructure of gas pipes etc. did have future cash flow to sustain it and the companies were able to survive and in some cases prosper. The technological defeat was only a partial one.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The immediate reaction of share prices notwithstanding, the apparent lack of success to back up Edison’s extravagant claims for a period left him a soft target: “Edison is not a humbug. He is a type of man common enough in this country – a smart, persevering, sanguine, ignorant show-off American. He can do a great deal and thinks he can do <span id="anchor_1713_62"></span>everything.”<a href="ch68.html#anchor_1892_0">⁴⁰</a> His penchant for talking directly to the press was criticised as part of his extravagant opinion of himself, and the scientific and commercial content of his work came under scrutiny.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The following article is noteworthy in its own right. Not only does it display the understandable scepticism of the time, it also must deserve a place in history as a scientific critique which simultaneously dismisses both the light bulb and the telephone as practical technological innovations!</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Even when Edison successfully demonstrated his illumination at his Menlo Park research centre, a substantial part of the press refused to believe it was anything other than a further publicity stunt. In this they were joined by enemies of Edison. William Sawyer used his own lack of success in overcoming the practical problems to argue that Edison could not have achieved what he claimed. A particularly damning piece was published in the</span> <span class="style1">Saturday Review</span> <span class="style0">in January 1880 shortly after Edison’s New Year’s Eve demonstration: “Three times within the short space of 18 months he has had the glory of finally and triumphantly solving a problem of worldwide interest. It is true that each time the problem has been the same [but] there is no reason why he should not for the next 20 years completely solve the same problem of the electrical light without in any way interfering with the interest or <span id="anchor_1722_153"></span>novelty.”<a href="ch68.html#anchor_1893_0">⁴¹</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Eventually Edison prevailed, and the New Year’s Eve drama and further demonstrations shifted the attacks from the success of the lamp to whether or not it was his invention. For Edison and his company the next step was to try and demonstrate commercial viability. Once again, this demanded his powerful presentation skills. Edison had focused on providing power in a densely populated urban area. This would minimise the power loss by reducing the distances current would have to be supplied from the central generator. His DC generators did supply enough power for his lamps but could not overcome the leakage problems endemic with solely-DC power supply.</span> </p>
