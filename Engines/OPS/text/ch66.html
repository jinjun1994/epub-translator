<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The arduous series of legal battles was only part of a wider conflict, though. Edison had championed the DC power supply while many of his competitors had travelled down the AC route. The method of power supply became increasingly important as the success of Edison’s lamp or light bulb increased. The DC power supply was better suited than AC to arc lighting, but the opposite was the case for incandescent lighting. The reason was that the DC power supply was efficient only in densely populated areas. The leakage of current meant that it was incapable of being sent any meaningful distance from the generator. As a consequence, if incandescent lighting was required, there had to be a generator in close proximity. With AC supply, on the other hand, a large central generator could supply fairly distant areas simply by stringing power supply cables. Edison’s vehement opposition to AC power supply rested primarily on safety grounds. It is difficult to know the extent to which his safety concerns reflected a genuine underlying belief. It should be noted that, while Edison publicly decried AC, he privately experimented with it at his research laboratories. It is difficult to believe he did this solely to demonstrate its lack of safety.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Edison had been aware of the potential of AC for some time and had even paid $5,000 (nearly $400,000) for the option on the rights for a European version to inhibit its competitive advances. The European AC transformer (the ‘ZBD’) had dramatically improved the performance of the plant Edison had installed in Milan. However, when William Stanley, a young inventor, offered Edison the rights to his transformer he refused. Instead, Stanley turned to a delighted George Westinghouse, who was to emerge as Edison’s most enduring competitor. Westinghouse was not new to the lighting business. He had achieved success previously, developing the use of natural gas in Pittsburgh. The company he founded there, the Philadelphia Company, leased gas acreage in western Pennsylvania and by 1887 had 5,000 residential and nearly 500 business customers. Between 1884 and 1885 he applied for 28 gas-related patents, most of them in respect of improving safety. One technique he used was to pipe gas at high pressure through long-distance trunk pipelines and then ‘step down’ the pressure in residential urban areas. This is very similar to the method he employed with AC supply in his electricity business.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Westinghouse had taken control of the United States Electric Company in the mid-1880s and was already a serious competitor to Edison. Moreover, Westinghouse had championed the cause of the use of AC for the distribution of electricity. Westinghouse’s ultimate leadership in the AC field was a consequence of the work of an individual rejected by Edison as being overly theoretical and impractical. Nikola Tesla, a Croatian who had transferred to New York from Edison’s Budapest facility, had his financial demands rebuffed by Edison in much the same manner that Edison himself had experienced from various financiers and employers. Tesla left to join Westinghouse and developed one of the milestone discoveries in the history of electricity – the rotating magnetic field. From this it was possible to develop the AC motor, transformer and dynamo. This represented a completely new stage in electricity’s development. However, this development almost caused the bankruptcy of the Westinghouse Electric Company. Although the Tesla induction motor was to become of vital importance to the subsequent success of Westinghouse, the extended and costly development period added so much to the increasing capital costs that in 1893 the company was near to financial collapse.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Westinghouse had acquired a patent for the incandescent carbon lamp developed by William Sawyer and Albon Man, and entered into cross-licensing agreements with Thomson-Houston on AC transformer patents to avoid a potential litigation minefield. With the addition of the transformer, he became a powerful competitor to Edison. By late 1886 Edison’s sales agents were writing to him, complaining about the successful encroachment of Westinghouse.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Edison fought a rearguard action and responded in his traditional manner. In public he launched an offensive against AC supply in general and Westinghouse in particular. In private he gradually increased research efforts on both DC and AC. Despite advances in DC technology, he was unable to match Westinghouse, and Edison’s sales agents began to desert him. Some even portrayed Edison as behind the times and a ‘fossil’. The public debate then took a more pointed turn. A New York engineer by the name of Harold Brown wrote to Edison and enlisted his aid in a crusade against the dangers of AC.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The scientific part of this crusade took the form of using high-voltage current to electrocute large numbers of small furry animals. The dangers of AC thus demonstrated, Brown wrote to leading figures in all the major towns in the US citing the dangers of AC and the number of accidental deaths already recorded. Westinghouse countered that by the time the current reached the consumer, the voltage was only 50 volts and safe. Brown’s campaign backfired: in 1889, New York opted to enact the death penalty via the use of electricity. Brown had demonstrated the ability of high-voltage currents to kill more than small furry animals by extending the tests to include a 1,200-pound horse. Thus convinced, the state bought three Westinghouse AC dynamos from Brown, together with an electrical cap and shoes for the sum of $8,000 (or over $500,000 in today’s dollars). There followed a morbid competition to name the new form of death. Various entries included ‘dynamort’ and ‘electricide’; Edison suggested ‘Westinghouse’!</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">It was to be some time before AC became the accepted power supply method. Scientists such as Lord Kelvin recanted and admitted that without Westinghouse’s development of the AC power supply, the level of development in electricity could not have happened with any rapidity.</span> </p>
