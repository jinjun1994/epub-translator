<title>Clear in retrospect, but rarely in advance - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<h1 id="anchor_4921_0"><span class="style1">Clear in retrospect, but rarely in advance</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The philosopher Søren Kierkegaard once memorably observed that “life is lived forward, but understood backwards”. In practice, it is usually only with hindsight that we can see how and why most of the technical and corporate success stories we know about today were destined to become long-term winners. By the same token the confidence with which investors typically embrace new technologies at times of rapid change may be understandable, but anyone who studies the historical record is more likely to come away with an appreciation of how little certainty, predictability or inevitability there is about technological advance translating into financial rewards, either for the key protagonists in the change process, or for the investors who seek to profit from their discoveries and inventions.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It is not much of an exaggeration to say that the corporate history of technological change is as much a history of heroic failure as it is of triumph and success. While in retrospect the winners are usually clear, there is a huge amount of survivorship bias in the data. At the time, what investors are faced with is rarely anything like as sure a thing as subsequently appears. There is a thin line between success and failure. Knowing this does not make the task of the investor any easier, as genuine technological shifts – ones that transform social and economic behaviour – cannot be ignored. Whole industries or ways of doing business can be made redundant when such shifts occur and companies which will not, or cannot, adapt are simply washed away.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This is really just another way of saying that businesses that seek to develop and exploit new technologies are, in the absence of patent protection or other monopoly features, inevitably high-risk, high-reward ventures. The risk involved in backing new or uncertain technologies is one reason why the returns from venture capital have historically been so high. The distinguishing feature of most stock market bubbles, on the other hand, is that for a brief period investors in public markets are prepared to pay ridiculous prices for businesses that ought by rights to command the much higher ratings and risk premia that are justifiably accorded to venture capital projects. They are periods when conventional and broadly rational relationships between risk and return are not just ignored, but turned completely on their heads.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Technological advances that hold out the promise of huge gains in wealth as rewards for riding a wave of profound change are particularly prone to creating such bubbles. At the peak of the Internet bubble, investors were paying prices for dot-com stocks and other Internet-related businesses with minimal track records and no earnings that implicitly assumed they were less risky than established companies with strong franchises that had been trading profitably for many years. This was not only clearly unsustainable, but a phenomenon that can only be explained by a rare combination of coincident conditions.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As with previous market bubbles, these conditions included:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">the emergence of a new and potentially transformative technology about which extravagant claims could be made with apparent justification</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">a climate of relatively easy money and credit conditions</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">general investor and consumer optimism</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">a wave of new publications promoting the merits of the new technology</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">an efficient supply machine, capable of creating a host of new companies to meet investor demand</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">suspension of normal valuation and other assessment criteria.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:3.75px;"></div>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">We can also observe that such periods are typically christened quite early on with a simple defining name or phrase that lends itself to exciting the popular imagination. The ‘Nifty Fifty’, which was used to characterise a relatively small number of fast-growing stocks in the late 1960s, is a classic example. ‘TMT’ stocks (short for telecoms, media and technology) became the watchword of the Internet craze. BRICs (the initial letters of four emerging markets) and FAANGs (an acronym for the big five Internet age stocks: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) are more recent examples. The emergence of such monikers is typically a sign that sentiment has replaced fundamental analysis in market valuations, and is usually the precursor of eventual widespread disappointment for those who embrace them.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As with earlier technologies, it has taken several years for the true impact of the Internet to make itself felt. Few people intially recognised that the first killer application would be email. No investor in 2000 had any idea quite how successful Amazon would turn out to be, nor that two companies which exploit the new world that the Internet helped create (Facebook and Google) would grow from nowhere to become two of the five largest companies in the world – while other companies with multi-billion-dollar market valuations at the height of the bubble would turn out to be more or less valueless. While the ‘connected world’ has become a reality, as the early pioneers hoped, it has not followed a blueprint that a majority of participants who were caught up in the bubble would necessarily have recognised.</span> </p>
