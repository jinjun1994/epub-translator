<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The success of the early Internet companies of the TMT bubble could be judged in two ways. One is the traditional method of estimating the profits they earned and the potential growth that lay ahead. The second is to measure the gains that the positive stock market reaction gifted to investors who jumped on the bandwagon early enough to cash in before the inevitable denouement. The two categories should in theory be related, but in reality only a small number of companies managed to obtain the profitability that their share prices at the peak seemed to be discounting. A much larger number ended up flattering to deceive. Investors were willing to accept valuations based on estimated future prospects which were becoming ever less tangible, and as a result the pace of company formation and flotation shot up at a prodigious rate. Supported by a low-interest-rate regime and a vibrant US stock market, for a while demand for new issues seemed insatiable. Throughout the latter part of the 1990s increasing numbers of ‘new economy’ companies were floated, not just on NASDAQ, the specialist American technology market, but also on equivalent markets in the Europe, Asia and Latin America. It was a global phenomenon. Typically substantial premiums to issue price were achieved on the first day of trading, delivering immediate profits to those who subscribed for shares. As the level of over-subscription was usually released as a running commentary ahead of the IPO completing, those profits were often effectively risk-free. These instant profits were a classic example of the ‘greater fool’ theory of investing and provided the fuel that kept the IPO engine running.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">How did this differ from previous technology bubbles? The answer is that it did not. The chart showing how rising share prices and the potential for immediate gains attracted investors’ capital in the railway mania of the 1840s is more or less identical to that which characterised the Internet bubble. Monetary conditions at the time of the railway and Internet bubbles, even allowing for the different historical circumstances and economic conditions, are uncannily similar. In the case of the Internet the most striking characteristic was the shortness of time it took to move from concept to public listing. As listed equity investors no longer cared about proof of profitability, it meant that there was little discrimination in the placing of funds. When pie in the sky was the prevailing imperative, one stock was as good as another.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The ‘bubble’ arose because collectively the implied profits that needed to be created to sustain the aggregate valuation of the sample were simply implausible. You did not even need to be in the Internet business to command an Internet premium. Higher valuations accrued to any business which could plausibly claim to have links to the emerging technology, however tangential. Telecom companies that were not even directly involved in the Internet at that stage had valuations which could not survive any form of sober analysis. Even traditional print media companies, which were to become among the most prominent victims of the new technology, saw their valuations ascend simply because they could be lumped in, on superficial analysis, under the broad ‘TMT’ moniker.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Experience from earlier bubbles suggested that professional analytical standards would inevitably slip as valuations became ever more absurd. Typically what happens is that the higher share prices move, the higher up the income statement analysts look to base their valuations. In the case of the Internet bubble, valuations moved up from profitability to revenues, and then beyond revenues to concepts such as website ‘hits’ and promises of future revenue some years ahead. While it can be justified to look beyond dividends and earnings to cash flow and revenue as an indicator of value, and out in time beyond a four- or five-year horizon, it rarely makes sense to do both at the same time. For the Internet bubble the horizon appeared to be off the scale on both counts. While companies such as Cisco benefited in the traditional way in its early years by delivering impressive revenue and profits growth, that phase soon passed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As investors watched the drama of the Internet unfold, they were increasingly prepared to accept the absence of profits so long as top-line revenue growth was evident. Eventually analysts resorted to using any type of metric they could find, however implausible. Measures such as the number of ‘eyeballs’ looking at a website, the number of visits made to a site and the ‘stickiness’ of those visits were now used to justify investment. Some analysts resorted to asserting that in the new economy ‘old’ techniques of valuation did not work and could therefore be discarded. Unfortunately it did not make their use as valuation measures any more justifiable than when share prices soared in previous technology bubbles.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Many companies also increased the proportion of employee remuneration paid in the form of equity. Investors in turn became increasingly complacent about the future dilution of their interest in the companies they owned and the risks involved in diverting precious cash flow to share buybacks rather than reinvestment in the business. Companies buying back their own shares were rewarded by a rising share price, apparently irrespective of the impact which the change in capital structure would have. In retrospect, it is clear that this new dynamic dangerously distorted the priority of CEOs. It also showed that investors had failed to learn one of the most important lessons of earlier technology bubbles. In the end, just as Fayant described when writing about the boom in radio shares nearly 100 years earlier, there is no escape from the scissor blades of cash flow. No amount of financial engineering can make up for the absence of profits and dividend-paying capacity, a classic red flag for investors.</span> </p>
