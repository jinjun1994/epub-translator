<h1 id="anchor_2798_0"><span class="style1">Marconi and the origins of wireless</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The transmission of information at the turn of the century was dominated by two mediums, the telegraph and the telephone. In the US, by now the world’s largest economic power, both media had come to be dominated by a single company. In the case of the telegraph, Western Union had emerged from the Civil War with a growing network of wires and increased its dominance both by acquisition and technological improvement and through its association with Thomas Edison and others. The telephone had been born of the work of Alexander Graham Bell and was thus protected by the patents taken out by its inventor. With the shelter provided by these patents, the Bell Companies grew to create a stranglehold over the telephone that by the end of the patent period was protected by their control of the telephone networks.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Although Bell’s Companies had received public support in the early years as they battled against the giant Western Union, this support waned as they too grew to the point of virtual monopolies. This was an era when many huge companies had emerged and the public had begun to view such concerns as enemies, fostering the increasing use of antitrust legislation to combat the price-fixing combinations that had formed. As the economy grew, so too did the media, whose readership expanded sharply. In the last 30 years of the 19th century, the number of daily newspapers sold in America quadrupled and the number of copies sold rose <span id="anchor_2802_107"></span>sixfold.<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3277_0">⁵⁹</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The radio, like the telephone and electric light, emerged from the great advances in physics that took place during the 19th century. In 1865 the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell put forward his theories on electromagnetic waves in his seminal work ‘A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field’. This work sought to provide a unifying theory to explain the transmission of waves and elicited huge excitement in the scientific community, but it was nearly 25 years before conclusive proof of his theories was provided by Heinrich Hertz. Experimentation continued in the universities of Europe but remained at a somewhat abstract level. It took a young man of Irish-Italian extraction to turn the theoretical advances into universal practical applications.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Guglielmo Marconi was born in 1874 and spent his early years at his father’s estates near Bologna. His mother was a member of the wealthy Jameson family of distillers and his father owned large estates in Italy. The commercial experience of his family undoubtedly helped him in the future. Recognising his aptitude and interest in physics, Marconi’s mother arranged a tutelage position with Professor Augusto Righi, Professor of Physics at the University of Bologna. Professor Righi had worked on a device that enabled transmitters and receivers of waves to operate on the same frequency. From him, Marconi gained the necessary background in physics and mathematics – and experience of the rigour of experimental work – that was to be vital in his endeavours in the field of electromagnetic waves.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Marconi returned to his father’s estates with the idea of trying to reproduce and improve on the work of Professor Righi and Heinrich Hertz. His aim was to take the knowledge developed in the fields of telephony and electromagnetic waves and find whether it was possible to transmit information through the atmosphere as waves, in the same way as current passes through conducting wires. The first rudimentary experiments were conducted in the attic of his home. Success came in December 1895, when he was able to transmit a signal nearly ten yards to a receiver, which then rang a bell. (His father suggested that, while it was interesting, there were easier ways to ring a bell.)</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The scepticism of his father lessened somewhat when, the following year, Marconi succeeded in transmitting messages by Morse code between receivers and transmitters more than one mile apart. Marconi had drawn on the work of Professor Righi and that of Oliver Lodge of Liverpool University to achieve his success. In this he was following experimental work being conducted round the world. Oliver Lodge had demonstrated a radio telegraph at the 1894 meeting of the British Association at Oxford. In contrast to Marconi, Lodge was more concerned with theory than in practical applications of his work, to the extent that he had not even bothered to patent his <span id="anchor_2810_108"></span>equipment.<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3278_0">⁶⁰</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Marconi, on the other hand, clearly foresaw the commercial possibilities. Supported by his mother, he travelled to London to meet William Preece, the chief engineer of the British General Post Office (GPO). The GPO had a monopoly of the telegraph system and was interested in Marconi’s demonstration of wireless telegraphy. Preece was sufficiently impressed to obtain an assistant for Marconi to help with his work. The assistant, George Kemp, was to remain with Marconi throughout his working life.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Spurred by this early success, Marconi obtained a patent for his work in 1896 and returned to Italy to demonstrate his equipment to the Italian Navy in 1897. Later that year, his cousin Henry Jameson Davis helped him form the Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company, which owned his patents and was set up to develop and market his equipment. The company was incorporated with capital of £100,000 ($37m), while Marconi received £15,000 ($5.5m) in cash, and £60,000 ($22m) in paid-up shares, as consideration for his patents. In 1900 this company changed its name to the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company. Several things enabled Marconi to push his work forward at such speed. Other than his own ability, the most important one was the support of his family. Marconi was not only free from financial constraints. He also had the advantage of his family’s business contacts. Perhaps as importantly, he also had the constant encouragement of his mother.</span> </p>
