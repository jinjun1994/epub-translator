<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The strategic importance of the radio as a means of military communication had been clearly illustrated during the Russo-Japanese War, and was the driving force for the international conferences that followed. Existing communication companies and related suppliers had shown interest in the medium, but had either been financially constrained from pursuing it, or had judged that the threat could be countered at a late date. In both cases, events were unfolding that would cause the structure of the industry to be dramatically altered.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Before this, though, the industry was to lose part of its anarchic structure and to be subjected to government regulation. The main factor that stimulated this was the sinking of the Titanic. The world’s largest luxury liner had struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage (one on which Marconi was originally booked as a passenger) and immediately radioed for help. Of the two closest ships, one was not equipped with radio, and the other had shut its engines (and hence the radio) off. Consequently, neither had picked up the messages. Not only that, but the help message had been unintentionally distorted by amateur radio operators with the result that two messages from separate ships were combined as a message that “All Titanic passengers safe, towing to <span id="anchor_3076_127"></span>Halifax.”<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3288_0">⁷⁰</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The radio message did serve to save the lives of those adrift in the freezing waters, and the press lauded the efforts of the Marconi operator and his company as a result. However, the lack of order in the airwaves meant that many more lives were lost than would otherwise have been. The public reaction was such that government regulation quickly followed. The regulation of the airwaves was part of the driving force for change in the industry, but the two major forces remained the strategic importance of the industry and the increasing attention being paid to it by the existing industry players.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The sinking of the Titanic and the tragic loss of life which accompanied it was an event of such a scale that it shocked the world. It was also the first event which was effectively reported live through the use of the radio. Undoubtedly the radio distress messages saved many lives. Undoubtedly lives were also lost due to conflicting signals and the lack of radio equipment and uniform transmitting protocols. The event accelerated action in all these areas and hence the development of maritime radio use. One other by-product also emerged: a voracious appetite for information – and newspaper proprietors who were willing to pay to satisfy it. One major headline reported on such an event shortly after the <span id="anchor_3089_120"></span>disaster:<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3289_0">⁷¹</a></span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">“While the world was waiting for three days for information concerning the fate of the</span> <span class="style1">Titanic</span><span class="style0">, for part of that time at least, details concerning the disaster were being withheld by the wireless operator of the steamship</span> <span class="style1">Carpathia</span> <span class="style0">under specific orders from T. W. Sammis, chief engineer of the Marconi Wireless Company of America, who had arranged for sale of the story.”</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Although the story reported in the paper was accurate in the sense that the radio operator had been advised to sell his story, it was inaccurate in the sense that the world was ‘anxiously’ waiting for information. The message was actually sent when the</span> <span class="style0">Carpathia</span> <span class="style1">was about to dock, a point which the American Marconi Company was anxious to stress given the public relations issue in question. The company’s rebuttal published in the same newspaper set out the timing and argued that it was only trying to allow the radio operators to earn some additional funds. In this it was largely successful, as subsequent reporting focused primarily on the heroic actions of the Titanic crew, passengers and rescuers, with particular attention paid to the role of the radio and its operators. That the</span> <span class="style0">New York Times</span> <span class="style1">managed to gain access to a full heart-rending account from the surviving radio operator, Harold Bride, for a fee of $500 ($26,000) no doubt helped to stimulate the articles by its rival paper.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">7.10 – Chequebook journalism appears</span> </p>
<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style1">New York Herald</span><span class="style0">, 21 April 1912.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The impact of the sinking of the Titanic was greatly to increase the impetus towards some form of regulation of the airwaves. Up to this point, the radio – more accurately, the wireless telegraphy industry – had targeted only those markets that the cable-based telegraph systems could not serve. It had not really become the potent threat to the telegraph and telephone companies that some of its protagonists had hoped, nor had it raised sufficient prospect of this threat to force these companies to buy them out. It was not that AT&amp;T had ignored radio, simply that no imminent threat had been perceived. Nor had any new opportunity been discerned – and the thinking of the time remained fixed on existing methods and uses of information transmission. The following decade would alter all this, but not because of any new ‘vision’. Rather, the technology embodied in the radio produced a number of spin-offs that proved to be of vital importance to existing companies. Soon to be overlaid on this was the outbreak of World War I, where the strategic importance of the radio demanded a new approach to the industry from government. This would fundamentally change the market environment for Marconi, who by 1912 had achieved the dominant industry position.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">While the Marconi companies had achieved a dominant position on both sides of the Atlantic, they had done so with a technology where substantial upgrades were soon to be required. Fessenden’s efforts had not produced a viable company. NESCO was in receivership and the only remaining sign of his involvement in the industry was the International Radio Telegraph Company, which came to hold his patents. De Forest’s series of companies, on the other hand, had been more concerned with selling shares to the public than developing viable businesses.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In both cases, however, they had worked with technology whose potential in certain respects exceeded Marconi’s capabilities. In Fessenden’s case, this advance related to the use of continuous wave generation and in De Forest it was the audion, the improvement on Fleming’s diode. Marconi had improved the reception capabilities of his equipment, but the most obvious area where the Marconi equipment was still lacking was in its reliance on spark technology for generating signals. By the immediate pre-war period it was evident that continuous-wave technology both produced more reliable signals and ones that carried the potential for voice transmission. Marconi was aware of this, and steps were taken to close the technological gap.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Unfortunately World War I intervened, causing a suspension of experimental work and the exercise of control over the network by the British government. Any experimental work targeted military needs. The focus was therefore on applications such as portable wireless, message-interception capability and direction finders to trace enemy signals. Above all, the focus was on massive expansion of the number of stations and trained operators. In this environment, research on continuous-wave-generated signals was simply not possible. Research and development into the radio therefore effectively stalled on one side of the Atlantic. On the other side, the opposite would prove to be the case.</span> </p>
