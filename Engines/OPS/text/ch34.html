<p><span class="style0">Both the reputation and the balance sheet of Union Pacific had been seriously undermined by the excesses of Credit Mobilier. Nevertheless, in 1873 the UP–CP route was the only operational transcontinental line and, in the right hands, Union Pacific represented a potentially powerful weapon. For an operator such as Jay Gould, it was probably almost irresistible. Gould knew the potential for the transatlantic routes and in respect of this, in 1872 he acquired an effective controlling stake in Pacific Mail, the steamship operation plying the west coast and linking Far Eastern routes out of San Francisco.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Gaining control involved the normal double dealing and share price manipulation. In this case it caused a rift between Gould and his erstwhile co-conspirator, Henry Smith, that ended in an acrimonious and irrevocable split between the two. Smith felt Gould had not only abandoned him, but also enlisted with the enemy to ruin him, by assisting Vanderbilt’s son-in-law, Horace Clark, to place a short squeeze on Northwestern Railways when Smith had been executing a bear raid. Smith retaliated by making public damaging documents on Gould’s previous financial practices with the Erie Railroad. This eventually cost Gould around $9m (nearly $700m) in restitution to the Erie Railroad. While Gould was able to afford this, the damage to Smith was much more severe, leading to a memorable exchange. Smith purple with rage, shook his finger in Gould’s face and sputtered, “I will live to see the day, sir, when you have to earn a living by going around this street with a hand organ and monkey.” “Maybe you will, Henry, maybe you will,” Gould cooed softly. “And when I want a monkey, Henry, I’ll send for <span id="anchor_1053_185"></span>you.”<a href="ch36.html#anchor_1150_0">¹⁴</a></span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">This interlude on Northwestern also tied Gould in with Union Pacific, whose stock the Vanderbilts had accumulated to allow them to tie the troubled railroad into the Vanderbilt network. In 1872, Clark had been elected President of UP, and the integration of the UP line seemed inevitable. Gould had accumulated some stock in UP, but the chance to obtain control fell to him with Clark’s sudden death in 1873 and the consequent sudden disposal of his stock on the market.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In 1874 Jay Gould was president of Union Pacific and, as with the Erie Railroad, soon used his position to enrich himself. The situation at Union Pacific was potentially dire. The balance sheet was burdened by huge debts, there was a price war with other carriers and the eastern markets were experiencing tough times economically. Gould dealt with the first of these problems by withholding interest payments and by capitalising interest expenses as construction costs. This had the accounting effect of increasing assets on the balance sheet, while decreasing expenses on the income statement, thus increasing profits. As regards the price war, Gould had the advantage of a stake in the competitor, Pacific Mail, and was thus able to ‘negotiate’ a truce at a time of his convenience. On the economic front he had no control, but was greatly assisted by the elements, in the form of harvest failures in Europe and bumper crops from the western United States. Gould also had a poorly run, high-cost operation in UP to contend with – one where he could bring his cost-cutting skills to bear.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As a result of these various factors, there was a sustained increase in the price of Union Pacific shares, which presented Gould the opportunity to sell his stake of 200,000 shares to the public at a profit in excess of $10m (over $800m). Even without this large shareholding, he was to retain substantial influence through his nominees and friends on the board. Nor was this the only profit Gould accrued from his time at UP. While running UP he had personally acquired controlling stakes in a series of railroads, most notably the Kansas Pacific and Denver Pacific, Wabash and Missouri lines. After a sequence of intricate manoeuvres involving William Vanderbilt and Henry Villard of Northern Pacific, and deals with smaller railroad lines, Gould was able to force UP to acquire his network for a further profit of $10m (over $800m).</span> </p>
