<title>Western Union changes tack - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<h1 id="anchor_1334_0"><span class="style1">Western Union changes tack</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The company was correct in one sense, in that the vision espoused by Bell would involve substantial investment. Western Union steadfastly held to its opinion that the telephone posed no competitive threat until one of its subsidiaries reported, barely a year later, that its telegraphs were being replaced by telephones. At this point it was galvanised into action. In December 1877, Western Union set up the American Speaking Telephone Company. This was capitalised at $300,000 ($25m), and headed by three of its most distinguished and eminent electrical inventors: Thomas Edison, Elisha Gray and Amos Dolbear. This formidable trio was perfectly capable of producing apparatus superior to that of Bell. With capital, backing and the wire network of Western Union behind it, the new company immediately sought to squeeze Bell out of existence.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Western Union attacked on a number of fronts. The dominance of the company’s wire network made market penetration relatively easy. The company could immediately hook its phones up to existing spare lines, whereas Bell’s group had to string new lines before connection was possible. The second line of attack came on pure technological grounds; Edison had developed a carbon button transmitter which made Western Union’s equipment vastly superior to Bell’s (although this position was swiftly remedied by the purchase of an improved transmitter from the inventors Emile Berliner and Francis Blake). Added to these attacks was a relentless smear campaign waged through the press to the effect that Gray had invented the telephone only to have it stolen by Bell. This, in spite of the fact that in March 1877 an exchange of letters had taken place between Bell and Gray, sparked by claims in the</span> <span class="style1">Chicago Tribune</span> <span class="style0">that Gray was the true inventor – and included in one letter was an explicit statement by Gray that he did not “claim even the credit of inventing it”. This correspondence was to assume pivotal importance in the events that subsequently unfolded.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Over the years that have passed since the invention of the telephone, and the creation of the giant company that it spawned, some very different schools of thought have emerged. Some authors, perhaps influenced by the dominant position that the Bell companies later achieved – and the monopoly practices they engaged in – contend that Elisha Gray was the true inventor of the telephone. They say that Bell altered his patent application and in effect ‘stole’ part of Gray’s application. The controversy is important, because it was a potential point of weakness for the Bell companies which speculators and competitors sought to exploit.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Bell’s patent has been described as “the most valuable single patent issued in any country”. It may well also be the most litigated patent issued in any country. On the same day that Bell filed his original patent, Elisha Gray filed a caveat – effectively a note of intent to file a future patent. The records show that Bell’s filing was the fifth entry and Gray’s caveat the 39th of the day. Some historians argue that since some of Bell’s patent was written in the margin, this provides evidence that it was written after seeing Gray’s caveat. It has also been suggested that the patent officer admitted to having shown Gray’s caveat to Bell. Others argue that Gray initially ridiculed Bell’s invention, then congratulated him on his achievement, explicitly saying that he had no claim to it as an invention. Indeed, they argue that Gray only laid claim to the invention of the telephone in 1886 after its practical and commercial viability was proven, meaning little credence should be attached to what was obviously a money-inspired claim.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Since two similar applications had appeared on the same day, the examiner for the US Patent Office, Zenas F. Wilber, followed procedure and suspended both for investigation. Hubbard’s lawyers appealed successfully, ensuring that Bell’s patent application was recognised as taking precedence, on the basis that it was filed first and was a full patent application while Gray’s was only a caveat. When Bell arrived in Washington in late February, he visited the Patent Office and spoke to the patent examiner. Bell was able to point out that he had submitted other applications 12 months before, for work which was similar to that in Gray’s later patent application. The examiner allowed Bell to amend his specification to refer to the prior application, and his 12 February 1876 patent application was accepted. On 7 March 1876 the US Patent Office issued a patent named ‘Improvement in Telegraphy’ to Alexander Graham Bell.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The saga of the patent application could have caused real problems, but the courts repeatedly dismissed claims against Bell’s patent and upheld his rights as the original inventor. Although Western Union was the most powerful company of the day, it was forced to capitulate in the face of the evidence supporting Bell. This was due in part to Bell’s habit of keeping extensive notes, and also to the presence in the partnership of Gardiner Hubbard, a man whose background as a patent attorney made him highly sensitive to the need to document research work to protect future rights. Any invention that turns out to be a success inevitably acts as a magnet to those intent on sharing in the wealth it creates. Bell eventually had to fight more than 500 cases against Western Union and others to protect his rights.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The landmark case was the one involving Western Union. The case demonstrated the importance of the telephone for all to see, and in effect was the foundation on which the future telephone industry and its domination by Bell’s company was built. That said, it took some time for the importance of the crude first telephone to be recognised, and for Bell to establish a commercial venture. Bell’s first step was to strengthen his management by recruiting Theodore Vail, former chief of the United States Railway Mail Service. Vail had managed a group of over 3,500 employees and developed a nationwide mail system. Bell’s second step was to commence a lawsuit citing a Western Union agent for patent infringement.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The capital position of the Bell company, still effectively funded by Sanders, remained weak. It was insufficient to sustain the growth of the business or the attacks from Western Union. As a consequence, a new company was formed to bring in further investors, and the presidency of the company passed to Colonel William Forbes. Within two months of Vail’s appointment, sufficient capital had been raised to launch the Bell Telephone Company with a capitalisation of $450,000 ($37m).</span> </p>
