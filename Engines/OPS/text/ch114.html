<h1 id="anchor_3170_0"><span class="style1">Development of the broadcasting industry</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There were three main schools of thought regarding broadcasting as a medium. The first came from the equipment manufacturers, who saw broadcasting as a mechanism to stimulate demand for product. The second came from amateur broadcasters who saw broadcasting as an exciting new hobby. The third school of thought was founded on the wider vision of broadcasting as a commercial industry in its own right. This final school of thought was based on the growing demand for information and entertainment by an increasingly wealthy and educated population. This demand had been demonstrated by the rapid growth of newspapers, and the radio would have seemed a natural progression – with the caveat of having to work out how broadcasts could generate revenue.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The obvious answer lay in advertising, a medium which proved to be an instant success when first tried in 1922. To give an idea of the audience growth involved: in the years up to the Depression the growth in radio sales averaged 100% per annum. Radios were not inexpensive items and in 1921 a ‘quality’ radio set from Westinghouse retailed at $60 ($1,600), with a lower-end appliance retailing at around $10 ($270). At RCA David Sarnoff had become general manager and was a strong advocate of the commercial possibilities of broadcasting in its own right as opposed to simply a method of selling sets. The first advert was a ten-minute talk extolling the virtues of a particular housing development, but others soon followed from major corporations such as Tidewater Oil and American Express. This first commercial was broadcast in the early 1920s on WEAF, a station of AT&amp;T, the company which had earlier treated the prospects for radio broadcasting with disdain.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Yet the broadcasting business was not immediately lucrative and neither were many of the concerns profit-making entities – some by design, others by default. The economics of the broadcasting business were unclear, and the delivery of the service was hampered by the anarchic nature of frequency use. Eventually government regulation was required to stop competing broadcasters from using the same frequencies as each other and causing reception problems through interference. With the commercial principle established, the big battalions began to respond in earnest. AT&amp;T followed the establishment of WEAF in New York with an attempt to restrict competition by refusing to allow competitors access to its lines to deliver signals to remote areas. This use of power by AT&amp;T was extended to forcing those who used its transmitters to play AT&amp;T commercials or pay higher charges (or both).</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This placed AT&amp;T in conflict not just with small broadcasters, but also its erstwhile patent partners. This group, known as the ‘radio’ group, lobbied for changes and eventually binding arbitration was required to remove the impasse. The arbitration found in favour of the ‘radio’ group and the commercial framework for establishing a freestanding viable business was thus established. In 1926, at the instigation of David Sarnoff of RCA, a new joint venture was formed with GE and Westinghouse to exploit this opportunity. This new entity leased AT&amp;T telephone lines to allow programmes to be distributed to a network of stations and purchased WEAF from AT&amp;T as its flagship for $1m ($23m). The entity was named the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and marked the true beginning of broadcasting. The economics of network broadcasting were based on the distribution of the same content across the whole system. So successful was the model that NBC expanded until effectively two networks were born, the red and the blue networks. Later these two networks would be completely split.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It was not long before a competitor arrived in the form of the United Independent Broadcasters (UIB). This was later augmented by a phonograph competitor of RCA who joined the financially suspect UIB company to provide access to the airwaves. The Columbia Phonograph Company thus became CBS, although its financial fortunes did not take an immediate upturn and it required a financial injection from one of its major clients to survive. CBS was therefore for a period controlled by the Congress Cigar Company of Philadelphia. In the meantime the growth of the sale of radios had continued apace and RCA had tried to mitigate increasing competition by licensing a number of companies, including one named Zenith, to manufacture radio sets.</span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">American Marconi/RCA</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The shareholders of American Marconi were treated to neither a detailed annual report nor any profits for the first ten years of the corporation’s life. The annual report typically consisted of a letter to shareholders and a balance sheet. The early letters to shareholders continued to promise progress in the development of wireless transmission. No income statement was provided until the company returned its first profit in 1911/12. Up to that point any profits or losses were treated as an entry on the asset side of the balance sheet. A profit-and-loss account was only recorded on the liabilities side when the accumulated losses of the company were finally overtaken by profits. The other feature of the annual reports in the first ten years was an almost continuous reference to litigation against patent infringement, the most frequent targets being Fessenden, De Forest and their respective companies. Relatively strong language is used in a number of cases, in particular in the 1907 annual report about a scheme to induce American Marconi shareholders to swap their stock for that of United Wireless as part of an alleged (but fictitious) merger with American De Forest. The most intriguing comment came in the 1912 annual report where the shareholders were advised that “matters of great importance, both regarding the welfare of this Company and also of the entire Marconi System, are now pending; these matters cannot be discussed in full as yet.” The eventual result of these discussions was a resolution of the litigation and the purchase of United Wireless, and with it close to a monopoly position in maritime radio off the American seaboard.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The financial statements up to 1912 show a company in the early stages of technological and commercial development. Losses were being made, but they were not of a magnitude to be alarming from a cash flow perspective. The returns might not have lived up to the grand promises of the early advertising, but neither was the company in a perpetual state of raising new capital. The problem in the early years, aside from the technology itself, was the competitive nature of the market and the actions of competitors willing to operate at substantial losses funded by issues of equity. This phase ended with the purchase of United Wireless, which immediately reversed the loss-making position. The returns could hardly be deemed excessive, with the return on assets barely exceeding 5% by the end of the war. This was not a spectacular figure after ten years where no profits were earned at all. For shareholders to have made any money, they would have had to have done so by selling into speculative share price moves. The market power needed to sustain returns over longer periods was never in place long enough. Before such returns could be earned, the business was transformed into RCA. For shareholders in RCA, by contrast, the ride to profits was an immediate one. Not only was there the benefits of the network that American Marconi had built up, but the pooling of patents by its major shareholders meant that the government had in effect sponsored the creation of a monopoly.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Even from the early days of RCA, its profitability was reasonable. The pooling of patent interests between AT&amp;T, GE, RCA and Westinghouse provided huge competitive advantages and prevented other competitors joining the market. RCA found itself with exploding sales and margins as a result. For the investor, the different phases of development would have presented different decisions. In the early years, the main issue was technological feasibility. Was Marconi on the right track, and, if so, was there sufficient patent protection? After the United Wireless acquisition, these questions were largely resolved. The issue then became the effective commercial delivery of the service and hence profits. During the war, this would have been difficult to analyse, with the added uncertainty of whether the assets would ever return to the private sector. When they did, and the transition to RCA took place, the shareholders found themselves with the protection of what was effectively a trust structure comprising the most formidable US companies in the business. The main losers were the British Marconi shareholders, who received a premium to the prevailing price but a return that bore little relation to what would have been received if the growth which was to follow had been taken into account. In other words, RCA inherited a structure that was poised for growth and where much of the physical and technical infrastructure was already in place and amortised.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The ten years that followed the creation of RCA were a period of explosive growth for radio-related companies and this is shown clearly in RCA’s returns up to the late 1920s. RCA was in many ways a flagship for the stock market of the period, with rapidly rising sales and net income. In the boom which preceded the 1929 Crash, the share price rose dramatically. The growth in sales was not one which could be sustained, and as saturation point was reached, it fell sharply. Combined with the effect of the Great Depression, and a falling stock market, it was to be many years before this level of sales or net income was reached again. The moral for investors was that care needed to be taken when extrapolating the growth rate of a new product from its initial launch into a more mature phase.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Competitors to the radio – mainly the newspapers – had at first decried, then ignored the new medium. When these tactics had not worked they refused to carry programming schedules. Eventually, however, when it was understood that the new technology was sustainable and growing, they sought to become owners, and where this was not possible, providers of content. Eventually the control of the radio manufacturing industry embodied in the structure set up by the US government became a target, and in 1930 the government filed an antitrust suit. Under pressure from the authorities, the monopoly was broken and NBC was to become a subsidiary of RCA.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Equally, by the 1940s the broadcasting power of NBC was subject to investigation and it was ultimately required to dispose of its ‘blue’ network, which subsequently became ABC. By and large, the newspapers did not change their stance on broadcasting and what perhaps should have been a natural extension of information dissemination from newsprint to voice became an industry under its own steam, one which evolved from the producers of boxes rather than the producers of content.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">If the threat of the radio was not sufficient, a further and potentially more potent threat was also evolving during the 1920s. In 1925 John Logie Baird had demonstrated the feasibility of the transmission of images. Although the mechanical technology embodied in his demonstration was ultimately to be superseded by an electrical version that developed into today’s televisions, the message was relatively clear. A medium was coming which could transmit moving pictures</span> <span class="style1">and</span> <span class="style0">voice both through wires and over the airwaves. One might imagine that for the participants in the industry at the time the significance of this would have been immediately perceived. The reality was that history was yet again to repeat itself.</span> </p>
