<h1 id="anchor_1448_0"><span class="style1">Conclusions</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The invention of the telephone owed much to Alexander Graham Bell’s experience in acoustics. Bell’s research work was conducted mainly from personal interest and for a long while was merely a sideline to his focus on improving telegraph technology. At the time, the popular view was that the lucrative returns were to be earned through speeding up telegraph messaging. Western Union, the industry giant, employed a staff of the most eminent scientists of the day to protect its position from attack. It had witnessed at firsthand the potential for damage if competitor companies obtained the patent on technological improvements. With scientists such as Thomas Edison, Elisha Gray and Amos Dolbear on its books, it successfully produced the Quadruplex and many other improvements.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For Bell, competing against such a formidable array of talent and finance was an uphill struggle. He had little hope of forging ahead of them with the telegraph. Western Union had seemingly every right to feel confident. It had control of the technology. It had control of the cable network, and it also had the finances. In a climate where investors’ confidence had been knocked by the crash of 1873, this latter point was particularly important.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Indeed, the financial strength of Western Union could – and should – have ultimately saved the company by protecting its leading market position. In an environment where funds were in limited supply and investors were sceptical, Bell and his backers ran desperately short of capital and were forced to offer the telephone patents to Western Union, the well-financed giant of the day. However, Western Union was unable to see the potential for the telephone, remaining convinced that the telegraph was still the future. It therefore turned down Bell’s offer. Events were not long in informing them of the error of this decision, but despite frantic efforts to recover, the company could not gain a lead on Bell and his established patents.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For Bell, the refusal of Western Union to buy his patents marked the birth of American Bell, the Bell operating companies and eventually AT&amp;T. The major milestone in this regard was the decision against Western Union and Elisha Gray, which confirmed Bell’s primacy and the strength of his patent rights. From this point forward, the fortunes of the two companies would march in opposite directions. The message was not lost on the stock market. As soon as the potential of the telephone became clear, the fortunes of those who depended on telegraph revenues went into relative decline. The only action that could have saved Western Union would have been to move swiftly and aggressively to adopt the telephone technology, but this action was barred by the court decision and the subsequent agreement which gave the Bell companies patent protection. From that point on, Western Union was doomed to become a stock market loser.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The early history of the telephone was all about barriers to entry. Up to 1893, Bell’s companies relied on the protection afforded by Bell’s patents. The exceptionally lucrative nature of the business attracted many new entrants and forced the Bell companies to use litigation aggressively to defend their position. In this they were largely successful. Although Bell did try to prepare for the period of when its patents expired, the early years made the company complacent and arrogant towards both competitors and customers. When the patents expired, the Bell companies’ initial defence rested on other patents they had acquired. However, these were less firmly founded. Public and legislative opinion had meanwhile begun to swing against the company, which was now perceived as one of the ‘trusts’. The independents soon established a foothold, and eventually a meaningful market share, but were always hampered by AT&amp;T’s control of the long-distance lines.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As far as AT&amp;T was concerned, the costs of doing business had risen significantly. As price and service moved on to a more competitive footing, profit margins began to fall. Although growth was reasonable, it could no longer be funded internally. The returns to shareholders fell accordingly. Eventually this resulted in a change in effective ownership and a new management structure. The first order of the day was to reduce competition, the second to reduce costs. Both were aggressively embarked upon with some success, but the former exercise soon brought AT&amp;T into conflict with the authorities who, spurred on by public opprobrium for America’s new combines, had become increasingly interventionist. The key decision for AT&amp;T was whether or not to continue with a course of action that would inevitably bring conflict with the authorities. The company preferred the route of compromise that would at least protect its dominant position within the industry. A solution was reached. It was to set the conditions for the company for the next 60 years. In this sense, the management was extremely forward-thinking.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Whether this was to the greatest benefit of shareholders or the economy is another question. The later history of the telephone was all about maintaining the core business of the corporation and avoiding charges of anti-competitive practices. This created a risk-averse attitude to the technologies and opportunities which were to come out of the technological advances which accompanied development and expansion of the telephone network. AT&amp;T was ideally positioned to become a major participant in the growth of radio and broadcasting, but it was effectively restrained by fear of the potential accusations of monopoly practices.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This is not to say, in either the early years or subsequently, that the telephone was not adopted for uses other than simple conversations. It did not take long for it to be utilised for direct marketing, a fairly obvious application since the early households with telephones were, by definition, wealthy households. Equally it was also seen as a medium for broadcasting: a subscriber base was built with music being played down the line on a pay-per-listen arrangement.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style3">Direct marketing</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">It was not long before the telephone was seen as a medium which could be put to other commercial uses. In the early years it was only businesses and the more affluent households that could afford the installation of a telephone. For the retailer, the household with a telephone had therefore almost pre-selected itself as a marketing target. The article from which the following extract is taken was written by a retailer explaining the use of the telephone in generating interest in purchases from the affluent part of his community:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“Not so long ago we arranged to have a representative of a high-class manufacturer of suits and waists visit our store for a short period. We asked him to bring a line of first-class goods, which even the swell trade could not find occasion to find fault with. When he arrived we telephoned every woman in town whose trade we had trouble winning for their best apparel. They listened to our argument, and in nearly every case promised us over the telephone to look over our samples…Women enjoy seeing nice things, and after we had notified them they seemed willing enough to pay our store a visit… The result of our efforts was to sell more to the bon-ton trade than we had ever been able to at any past time… Sending clerks or errand boys does not result in so much effective returns.”</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style3">The response</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Retailers might have been enthused by the cost advantages and targeting afforded by the use of the telephone, but households did not necessarily feel the same degree of warmth towards the practice.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“ ‘My telephone is far more of a nuisance to me than it is a convenience,’ said a housekeeper yesterday, ‘and I think I will have it removed, if I am called up as much in the future as I have been during the past week by theater agents, and business firms, who abuse the telephone privilege, using it as a means of advertising. My hands were busy moulding bread yesterday morning, when I heard the bell ring, and upon responding was told by a woman just gone into business in a main street building, that she had a fine line of curtains… Shortly afterwards an employee of another firm making extracts solicited patronage in the same way… Last week a number of my friends and I heard of a Shakespearian actor who was to fill a long engagement here, and we were asked by a theater attaché to please get our seats early, as there would undoubtedly by a rush for tickets. These are samples of a telephone annoyance that I would like to be freed from.’ ”</span> </p>

<p><span class="style1">–</span> <span class="style0">Telephony</span><span class="style1">, 20 February 1909</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Unfortunately for the householder reported above, the plea for freedom from unsolicited advertising was to fall on deaf ears with the practice simply being extended and refined during the century which followed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style3">Music on the telephone</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">In the case of the telephone music service, it was first set up in Delaware in 1909 by a company called the Tel-musici Company. The service involved the subscriber calling in and requesting the music to be played. The operator then placed the music on the phonograph and the subscriber switched on the loudspeaking equipment attached to the phone. The service cost three cents a piece and seven cents for grand opera! It was received with much initial enthusiasm before the technology of music reproduction and the radio made it redundant:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“Much of the success of the system is due to the unique and remarkable loud speaking transmitter… [and] the fact that the cost of installation is very low and that the special receiver and horn attached to it can be mounted in any room however remote from the telephone itself, thus enabling the subscriber to place it where it will be least conspicuous and in the way. It will also be appreciated that another point which strongly appeals to prospective subscribers is the fact that no initial expense is necessary on his part and that all he has to do in order to have the most entertaining of music, whilst at the same time without venturing out into cold or inclement weather, is merely to step to his telephone and notify the central office.”</span> </p>
