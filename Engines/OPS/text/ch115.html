<p><span class="style0">The work of John Logie Baird had been based upon the use of the ‘Nipkow’ disk. This was developed by the German scientist Paul Nipkow in the 1880s and provided a method by which an image could be broken into electrical signals, transmitted to a receiver and then reassembled through mechanical scanning. Logie Baird had succeeded in taking the science of the demonstration to a practical form. As with pretty much all inventions, he was not alone in his development work, and much of it was paralleled in Germany, Russia and America. For Logie Baird the development of the television was a difficult path, with financing hard to obtain and ridicule never far away. When he approached Andrew Gray, the general manager of the Marconi Company, the following exchange took place (as related by Baird):</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“Good morning,” I said.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“Good morning,” said Mr Gray.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“Are you interested in television?” said I.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“Not in the very slightest degree. No interest whatsoever,” said Mr Gray.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“I am sorry to have wasted your time. Good morning,” I said and left <span id="anchor_3226_15"></span>immediately.<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3291_0">⁷³</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Logie Baird was treated no better by the editor of the</span> <span class="style1">Daily Express</span><span class="style0">, who had him removed from the newspaper’s offices doubting his sanity. One might have supposed that newspapers would have quickly realised the potential for the new medium given their own history. The news industry had long used visuals to help increase circulation. The largest selling paper was one that focused on images. The first edition of the</span> <span class="style1">Illustrated London News</span> <span class="style0">was produced in May 1842, cost sixpence and featured 32 woodcut images ranging from the war in Afghanistan to a train crash in France and a fancy dress ball at Buckingham Palace. The paper was an immediate success, with circulation climbing to over 300,000 weekly, making it nearly six times more popular than</span> <span class="style1">The Times</span><span class="style0">.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Eventually, after repeated demonstrations, Logie Baird was able to raise funding and a company was launched in early 1927 with a public subscription. This elevated Baird’s lifestyle but brought interference from the board chairman, who was also chairman of Daimler Motors. Baird circumvented this problem by having the entrance to his laboratory made of sufficient width to allow him entrance, but deny that of his rather portly chairman. The problems which faced Baird, though, extended beyond his own chairman. Later in 1927 AT&amp;T announced its own successful transmission of pictures based upon technology which had similar antecedents to that of Logie Baird. This would have appeared extremely threatening given the resources of AT&amp;T, but the threat was never to materialise as AT&amp;T maintained its lack of interest in broadcasting and eventually discontinued the research on the basis that it would not result in a cost-effective sound-and-picture telephone. In this decision AT&amp;T was both right and wrong. The company was correct in the limitations of the disk technology, but wrong in the prospects for picture transmission. AT&amp;T was not alone in working on picture transmission and other members of the patent pool were following the same path. Eventually the work of GE, Westinghouse and RCA was pulled together in RCA Victor Company under the supervision of a Russian émigré named Vladimir Zworykin. Simultaneously on the US West Coast, a young scientist named Philo Farnsworth was working towards the development of a television system that avoided the problems associated with mechanical scanning.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">What followed from the work of Zworykin and his associates and Farnsworth was in many respects similar to the trials and tribulations of the early days of radio. RCA visited Farnsworth to investigate the worth of his inventions, and they were sufficiently impressed for Sarnoff to make an offer to buy out his patents, but not sufficiently threatened to make the offer an overly lucrative one. Farnsworth on the other hand wished to maintain ownership of his patents and receive a royalty in return for their use – and hence refused the $100,000 offer. RCA would not countenance the payment of royalties: as Sarnoff was reported to have frequently stated, RCA was in the business of collecting royalties, not paying them. RCA was confident in its position, not so much from the scientific angle as from the commercial one. Radio manufacturers could not remain in business without a licence for RCA, and which one of them would risk their financial future by betting on a new unproven technology from an under-financed company when to do so would surely result in the revocation of their manufacturing licence? Hence RCA felt confident that, through litigation and market power, Farnsworth’s operation could be brought to heel.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Certainly when Logie Baird had agreed broadcasting terms with the New York station WMCA, and received approval from the Wireless Commission in Washington, Sarnoff and RCA quickly appealed and ensured a ruling against foreign ownership of any broadcasting in America. Farnsworth struggled against the pressure exerted by RCA to the extent that ironically the only option appeared to be to try and penetrate the market in Britain – where the BBC had been broadcasting television programmes for some time but were labouring under the limitations of Baird’s mechanical scanning system. The trip to Britain was to prove successful and provide some much-needed revenue for Farnsworth, sustaining his company in the ongoing litigation against RCA.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The eventual result was that RCA lost the patent verdict and was forced to license Farnsworth’s inventions for the remainder of their patent lives. In the meantime, though, the market power of the radio trust had attracted increasing disquiet and eventually the companies were forced to break their links. RCA, though, was to emerge from this with its virtual monopoly on radio intact, and with Sarnoff’s position strengthened by the removal of the influential corporate shareholders. Sarnoff had proven the victor in most of his battles, including those involving erstwhile allies at GE and Westinghouse. He could no longer circumvent the patents held by Farnsworth, who had survived more than ten years of pressure from RCA, and in 1939 was forced into an agreement with the resolute patent holder. RCA was to augment its dominance of the radio broadcasting industry with a similar strength in television, now that it had secured access to the necessary patents to complete the picture broadcasting system.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For Farnsworth the future was less bright. His television company proved unable to compete with the giant RCA and other competitors who entered the market, and with the expiry of his patents the company was eventually taken over by ITT, with Farnsworth fading from sight.</span> </p>
