<p><span class="style0">The transmission of information had taken massive leaps forward in the preceding 50 years. The telegraph had rapidly become a vital means of communication after the Civil War in America. It spawned Western Union, the industry giant which enjoyed virtual monopoly powers. More recently, the Bell Companies had made big inroads into the traditional telegraph business with their new device, the telephone, which created a brand new market, linking businesses and increasing numbers of households. Both these mediums were bound by one constraint. They required users to be connected by physical links. This made them unsuitable for many groups of would-be users, for whom rapid information transfer and communication were of the utmost importance.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">By virtue of its maritime pre-eminence, the largest potential customer for the radio was the British Navy. At that time, Britain had the largest naval fleet in the world, and was desperately seeking the solution to the communication problems which had been created by recent advances in shipbuilding. Before the advent of the ironclad, signalling between ships of the fleet was conducted by semaphore from the admiral’s vessel, sailing in the van. However, ironclad ships – those of the ‘Dreadnought’ class – were so large and powerful that they had to sail at least half a mile apart. A fleet of a dozen ships could therefore easily stretch over at least six miles of water, which threatened to make semaphore redundant. The maritime market was wide open for a technology that could resolve this growing communication problem. In the tense political conditions of the time, Europe’s arms race showed little signs of slackening. Both the size and capabilities of navies were key issues for the major European powers.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">As the biggest and potentially most important customers were in the UK, Marconi concentrated on sea trials with the Royal Navy through much of 1898. Britain was not alone in conducting wireless trials. The Russian Imperial Navy, for example, was experimenting on similar lines. The association with the Royal Navy was a help to Marconi in his developmental work, but not the only arm of government in his sights. The General Post Office, which held the monopoly of cable-based information transmission in Britain, was also a target. Marconi believed he had a strong relationship with Preece, its chief engineer. It was only later that he began to realise that Preece’s interest in his efforts was far from even-handed, given the latter’s own scientific aspirations in the radiography field.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Whatever the relationship, the British government proved to be both slow and intransigent, and as a consequence Marconi was compelled to explore more actively the commercial potential in America. The market Marconi was addressing was conditioned by the most obvious needs of the time. These needs were principally maritime, with ships needing to communicate with each other and with land. The other important market was that for long-distance communication, and in particular the lucrative transatlantic route, where a small number of telegraph companies dominated traffic, effectively acting as a cartel. Both these target markets shared a common characteristic: they involved the transfer of information from one single point to another.</span> </p>
