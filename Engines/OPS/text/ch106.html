<p><span class="style0">Marconi was not blind to the problems and sought to address them by hiring the necessary expertise. He employed John Ambrose Fleming, first as a consultant, then subsequently as an employee. Fleming was a former colleague of Maxwell’s and later professor of electrical engineering at the University of London. He was also a former adviser to the Edison and Swan Electric Company in Britain, for whom he had conducted experiments on incandescent lamps with carbon filaments. Fleming set out the theoretical properties of the waves used in radio transmission and hence provided a scientifically robust underpinning for the practical work of Marconi. Fleming’s theoretical knowledge and his practical experience of carbon filament lamps were to prove invaluable to Marconi.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">As well as hiring Fleming, Marconi himself also worked hard to remedy the problems of transmission and reception. On the former he extended the work completed by Oliver Lodge, effectively building a working tuner using matching inductance in the transmitter and receivers. In this he removed the problems of relying on the aerials. Once completed, he applied for and was granted a patent. This patent, number 7777, was to prove vitally important and as such was heavily litigated against. The problem of reception was solved, building on previous work by Lord Rutherford, to create a receiver to replace the device known as the ‘coherer’ which was both slow and unreliable. Using the demagnetising properties of electromagnetic waves discovered by Rutherford, Marconi was able to build a receiver to create sounds which could be heard through headphones when signals were received. Rather than recording messages directly onto paper strips, the apparatus would now rely on operators trained to distinguish the different tones.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">At the same time Marconi set out to conquer the third main problem with his work, that of long-distance transmission. His target was to confound his critics by transmitting a signal across the Atlantic. There were many eminent scientists who disputed that such a task was theoretically possible. A popular response to the idea of long-distance transmission was that the curvature of the earth would prevent radio signals being received beyond the horizon. The only way a broadcast could be made across the Atlantic, therefore, was to build impractically tall transmitters. This represented the existing body of knowledge at the time. Like other contemporary scientists, Marconi had no theoretical solution to this proposition. His approach mirrored that of Edison; he simply chose to ignore such inconvenient theories. His subsequent practical success was shown to be possible because of the impact of the ionosphere in reflecting high-frequency waves. Marconi continued to experiment until he had transmitted signals sufficient distances to justify the expenditure of a full trial between the two continents.</span> </p>
