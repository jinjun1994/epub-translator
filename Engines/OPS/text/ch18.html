<p><span class="style0">The canal companies responded much the same way as the competitors they had earlier superseded. They cajoled Parliament to oppose and slow the establishment of the railways, while also seeking subsidies and the removal of restrictions on canal operation in order to aid their competitiveness. By the 1830s, however, declining profitability made it impossible for canal companies to raise new capital. The railways had become the investment of choice. Their superior economics effectively sounded the death knell for the canals. By the 1850s, canals had become of peripheral importance as an investment medium.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Before the railways, canal shares were steady performers in both relative and absolute terms, roughly doubling between 1811 and their peak nearly 15 years later. In some cases, canal shares also paid 10% annual dividends, meaning that the investor was receiving handsome total returns. After the market peak in the mid-1820s, however, their loss of competitiveness was reflected in the behaviour of their share prices. From that point on, as shown in figure 1.2, the shares consistently underperformed the market.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">This demonstrates another timeless lesson that investors need to learn about new technologies. A theme that recurs throughout this research is that while identifying the winners from any new technology is often perilous and difficult, it is almost invariably simpler to identify who the ‘losers’ are going to be. The canals simply could not match the capacity and efficiency levels of the railways, and their eventual demise should have been evident to any perceptive investor by the 1830s.</span> </p>
