<title>The search for illumination - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<h1 id="anchor_1533_0"><span class="style1">The search for illumination</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">One of the main scientific quests of the 19th century was the search to find a cheap, effective form of illumination. The Industrial Revolution had generated increased levels of economic growth, population and wealth creation. With them came increased demands for better working and living conditions. Chief among these was the need to improve the standard form of lighting, which was a wick set in animal fat. The candle had been the chief source of light for centuries, and while various qualities of fat were used – including the fat from sperm whales for the high-income end of the market – little progress had been made since ancient times in finding an alternative source.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The demand was certainly there; so great was it that the schools of whales that once roamed the Atlantic had been hunted out of existence or forced away from their traditional feeding grounds. Whalers had to range as far as the Pacific in search of their prey. As a consequence, supply tightened and costs climbed. Whale oil prices rose to $2.50 per gallon (almost $400 a gallon in today’s terms), promising high potential returns for viable alternatives. In any case, the light produced by these candles was not particularly bright, it was noxious and the danger of fire was ever-present. What was required was a low-cost light of sufficient brightness to complement the other huge advances in production, transport and communication that accompanied the Industrial Revolution.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">At the time there appeared to be two distinct market segments. First, there was lighting for the home, hitherto satisfied by the candle, and second, there was lighting for communal areas, whether these were the workplace, public streets or buildings.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the first segment, the main early alternative to animal-fat-based lamps was camphene, a highly flammable turpentine-based oil. While an excellent light source, camphene’s flammability made it a constant fire hazard. Its unfortunate habit of exploding undermined its claim to be the lighting of choice in the family home. A more promising source was coal gas, also known as ‘town gas’, which was distilled from coal and piped through urban areas to provide both street lighting and domestic illumination (for those who could afford it). It was reasonably effective, but the cost made it prohibitive for all but the wealthy. The flammability and illuminating properties of coal gas had been known since ancient times, but its development as a practical source of light on any scale had to wait for progress in the science of chemistry. The study of hydrocarbons had long attracted many scientists as a potential fertile ground for producing a suitable high-quality illuminant. Although an expensive form of lighting, town gas existed as a profitable monopoly. This in turn provided an incentive for the study of other hydrocarbons as substitutes for camphene and town gas.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Most notable among the hydrocarbons was oil. The study of oil at this point was primarily driven by the need for light rather than in anticipation of its use as a propulsion fuel. In 1854 Dr Abraham Gesner applied for the US patent on the process of extracting and manufacturing a ‘new liquid hydrocarbon’, which he named ‘kerosene’, from the Greek words</span> <span class="style1">keros</span> <span class="style0">meaning ‘was’ and</span> <span class="style1">elaion</span> <span class="style0">meaning ‘oil’. Meanwhile, in Scotland, James Young had also produced a refining process based on cannel coal, which was used to produce ‘paraffin’. Refining of oil products was not an entirely new process. Oil-based products had been used in various forms for many centuries, stretching back to Babylonian times. In Europe, kerosene equivalents were common, particularly in Eastern Europe and in Romania, where crude oil was extracted from hand-dug shafts and refined into a lighting fuel. In mid-19th-century Vienna, kerosene was a common commercial product. In Eastern Europe in the mid-1800s, it was estimated that annual crude oil production numbered somewhere around 36,000 barrels, minuscule compared by today’s standards but a meaningful figure at the time.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The real significance of the ‘discovery’ of kerosene was that it stimulated the search for rock oil, or as it is now known, crude oil, which many then saw as a potentially low-cost alternative source for the refining and production of kerosene. The commercial logic was that kerosene was capable of replacing both camphene and town gas as the main source of public and private lighting. That assessment was correct. Kerosene was to capture enough of the residential market for lighting to provide an extremely high return on capital for an extended period. It took more than 40 years from the development of the Pennsylvania oilfields before electricity could be produced sufficiently cheaply to replace kerosene as the dominant source of supply in the residential lighting market.</span> </p>
