<p><span class="style0">Commercial exploitation of this type of potential had a long history in America. Not surprisingly, a repeat was in store. Critical in this was the decision of the NSF to relinquish control of the National Research and Education Research Network. (NREN). Originally this network had an ‘acceptable use policy’ which (aside from email) restricted access to non-commercial use. In 1992, a far-reaching proposal was made to change this. Then, in 1994, the NSF announced that NREN was to be privatised and reorientated to encourage commerce and competition. Finally, in April 1995, this happened. A network that had been publicly funded through various evolutionary phases since its inception nearly 40 years before was now in effect privatised.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Before the introduction of the World Wide Web and the privatisation of the Internet, the principal commercial opportunities were inevitably focused on the existing user base, which was mostly financed by the public purse. Software and hardware had to be attractive to these groups. Cisco’s early success, for example, reflected the growth in email traffic and users. However, this was ultimately constrained by the nature and size of the user base. Until the number of users broadened, product growth would be tied to the needs of the academic and government communities. It was not until the early 1990s that the elements for broader growth began to fall into place. The World Wide Web created the framework, Mosaic the entry point, and privatisation of the NREN the potential for commercial gain. Suddenly, after 30 years of investment and research, a new industry had been created.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">In the early years, there had been few companies with the insight or the knowledge to exploit the potential of the Internet. Those that possessed both were actively involved in Internet-related work and were now in a position to commercialise their activities. The major powerhouses in the industry, on the other hand, had largely shunned the Internet and related applications, either on the basis that commercial activity was proscribed, or because they had simply failed to forecast the growth that would occur. Microsoft and the other big players gave newcomers the space to enter the market, without the crushing competition that might have been expected from such wealthy firms. One of the earliest players to emerge boasted the kind of product that was necessary to bring access to the Internet to a wider audience: the browser. Before the browser appeared there were also a number of companies set up to provide access to the Web – later known as Internet service providers (ISPs).</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">In his book,</span> <span class="style1">Weaving the Web</span> <span class="style0">(2000), Berners-Lee records how he sought to stimulate the development of easy-to-use browsers to encourage increasing use of the Web. Other authors dispute this, suggesting that his concept centred on individual browsers for researchers, as opposed to the mass-market approach of Netscape’s founder, Marc <span id="anchor_4275_51"></span>Andreessen.<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4883_0">⁹⁸</a> Whatever the history, increased use of the Web created growing demand for easy-to-use browsers. Without the ability to ‘browse’ – to retrieve, display and navigate through information – the Internet would have remained a replacement for the traditional postal system and never reached the dreams expressed by Engelbart or Nelson. This was not lost on developers, and as use of the Web began to grow exponentially, the more commercially aware of them sought to take advantage. Marc Andreessen, who had helped develop the Mosaic browser, left NCSA to join Enterprise Integration Technology. Shortly after that, in April 1994, he founded Mosaic Communications Corporation with Jim Clark, formerly of Silicon Graphics. The Mosaic browser was to the Web what the Apple Mac had been to personal computing – and for the same reasons. It was user-friendly, with a graphical user interface that allowed users to issue instructions and browse by pointing and clicking with a mouse.</span> </p>
