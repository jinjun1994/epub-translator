<h1 id="anchor_3379_0"><span class="style1">The race to find other uses</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The immediate problem that Hollerith faced was that despite the success of his apparatus in the census, a business could not be sustained by waiting ten years for each new contract and having the equipment lie idle in between. Although orders were received from foreign governments, it was clear that alternative uses had to be found and the equipment modified if the company was to be commercially viable. The economic backdrop to this was not auspicious. The early 1890s were characterised by severe economic conditions and widespread business failure. It was against this backdrop that Hollerith had to persuade companies to invest potentially substantial sums in a relatively unproven set of equipment which would assist in tabulating information.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Hollerith concentrated on the dominant companies of the time: the railroads. The railroads had huge data management requirements relating to goods shipments, receipts and timetabling. The need for improvement in their ability to handle and analyse data was self-evident. What Hollerith had to do was persuade them that his equipment represented the solution. First, though, he had to modify his machines to make them suitable for the business community. The system he devised used one machine to punch the cards, a second to process and tabulate results, and a final one to sort the cards. The machines were powered electrically but operated mechanically. They depended heavily on the card system employed. Major revisions were made to the card to make it intelligible to the operator and a logical storage medium that could be easily manually interpreted if necessary. This was achieved by the introduction of different data fields categorised by type.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">With a prototype in hand, Hollerith then sought to persuade the railroads to adopt his equipment. Not surprisingly, given its unproven nature and the underlying business conditions, his early efforts were not successful. Eventually he managed to persuade the New York Central to take the equipment on a trial basis, but only after he offered it at no cost to the railroad. Unfortunately, teething troubles led to the railroad jettisoning the equipment after a relatively short space of time. Hollerith had been in Europe negotiating the sale of census equipment to the Russian government at the time, and he returned with a pressing need to modify his machinery and restore confidence.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Once he had dealt with the technical problems, Hollerith returned to the New York Central with a proposal to install and operate the machines for 12 months free of charge and with no obligation. Given that his financial position was precarious, with his company only sustained by the sale of assets and borrowing, this represented a final throw of the dice. Before long, however, Hollerith was approached by the Library Bureau in Boston, offering to act as his agent for his non-library clients. Libraries were well-versed in cataloguing techniques and more able to see the potential of his machine.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Thus relieved of capital commitments and ongoing services liabilities, Hollerith was in a position to continue his efforts to expand his business. Within a short space of time his equipment had proved its worth with the railroads and a lucrative order was received. Shortly before the end of 1896 his efforts to build a business outside the US also started to bear fruit. After much lobbying, Russia signed up for his equipment with an order worth $67,000 ($5m). Hollerith was particularly astute with this order, insisting on full payment in advance rather than the usual lease terms that he applied in the US. As a consequence he avoided the sovereign risk that was to arise when the Russians started to default on their debts. Hollerith was also astute in recognising the benefits of retaining control over the supply of data cards. In many ways this was similar to the policy of Marconi in leasing equipment with operators. The supply of cards ensured a lucrative ongoing relationship which often exceeded any profits from the supply of the equipment itself.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Buoyed by the success with the New York Central and the forthcoming Russian order, in December 1896 Hollerith incorporated the Tabulating Machine Company in 1896, thus laying the foundations for the industry giant (IBM) that was to emerge years later. The new company was financially viable and soon sought to obtain greater control of its own destiny by ending the agency contract with the Library Bureau and bringing the manufacture of equipment under its own roof. The company received the contract for the 1900 census from its new head, William Merriam, his predecessor Porter having returned to Britain to incorporate his own version of Hollerith’s endeavour, the British Tabulating Machine Company (later International Computers).</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Unfortunately the relationship with the Census Bureau deteriorated from that point forward and when Merriam, who had left the bureau to become president of the Tabulating Machine Company, began negotiations with his replacement he found that the environment had changed dramatically. The turn of the century had marked a substantial change in sentiment towards ‘big’ business. The trusts were now perceived as enemies of the people, abusing their monopoly position at the expense of the country. This sentiment was not reserved solely for Standard Oil and the railroads. Any large successful company tended to be tarred with the same brush and the Tabulating Machine Company found itself in this category.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The new superintendent at the Census Bureau believed that the census was being overcharged and that better terms could be achieved. The difficulty was that there was a dearth of competitors to Hollerith’s product and the bureau’s negotiating position was ostensibly weak. Its response was to create a competitor. He sought $40,000 ($2.4m) funding for a research department to create alternative equipment. He also altered the patent that protected Hollerith machinery. In defending itself against this patent infringement, the problem for TMC was that there was no legislative provision for litigating against the government. In any event, suing your largest customer was self-evidently not a prudent move. The litigation that followed was ultimately inconclusive as, by the time the final decision was reached, the 1910 census equipment had been installed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For the Census Bureau, the net result of its pre-emptive strike was the creation of a competitor, but at the expense of substandard equipment and higher cost in the short run. The competitor became a private entity when the head of the department set up by North, a Russian immigrant with the anglicised name James Powers, left to form his own company. For TMC there was the satisfaction of the vindication of its equipment, but set against this was the new and real competitive threat of Power’s company. For Hollerith personally, the battle with the government, combined with his ill health, might have contributed to control of the company passing to an entrepreneur named Charles Flint.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Flint had previous experience in business. Like many businessmen, he sought to obtain the best prices he could for the products he sold. He also recognised that the acquisition of Hollerith’s company would create a powerful consolidated group that could dominate the industry. Under the deal that followed, the ailing Hollerith was paid $1.2m ($65m) for TMC, which allowed him to live out his life in luxury. The new group was called CTR, and the same company that Thomas Watson joined as general manager after NCR. Watson’s background at NCR made him an ideal candidate to take the new company forward. He had seen firsthand the growth in the market for business machines and the importance of incentivised sales techniques and after-sales service. Realising the potential that CTR held, he carefully negotiated himself an employment contract which allowed him a share of the company’s profits as part of his compensation.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">So far as Sloan &amp; Chase, the company created by Powers, was concerned, it was eventually sold to Remington Rand. Remington Rand later became part of Sperry Rand, which in turn ultimately transmuted itself into Unisys. The main lesson was that while nature might abhor a vacuum, customers abhor a monopoly, even if that monopoly delivers the best product. Governments are often the most assiduous fighters against monopoly. The example of Hollerith’s fallout with the Census Bureau is not an isolated one. Governments have repeatedly treated existing statutes and patents as minor obstacles when they conflict with a course of action they wish to pursue.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style1">The most striking element to the progress of IBM is not the steady growth of the early years but the way in which it was completely overshadowed in the period after World War II once the mainframe computer had made it a mainstream company. In the early years of the company, income growth was very strong, averaging somewhere between 15% and 20% per annum, and doing so against a backdrop of a strengthening balance sheet and rising returns on assets and equity. As positive a picture as this was, it bore no relationship to what happened between 1950 and 1970 when the growth path of income turned from strong to a pattern verging on the exponential. Although growth slowed slightly after the initial impact of the introduction of the personal computer, the return IBM earned on invested capital remained in double digits.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The most interesting aspect of the history of IBM’s returns is the decline in the return on assets, offset by a slight improvement towards the end of the 1990s. The sharp upward movement in the return on equity is marked, rising to levels well in excess of anything earned during the most vibrant periods of the company’s distinguished history. These returns did not flow just from a rapid increase in net income, but from a capital restructuring which saw the debt/equity ratio advance to over 100%. Since 2000 the level of financial gearing has continued to rise and with it the return on equity. Return on assets has not followed the same trajectory, suggesting that profitability is ever more sensitive to financial engineering and vulnerable to a rise in debt costs.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">In February 1924, ten years after the arrival of Watson, CTR changed its name to International Business Machines (IBM), a name it had been using in Canada since 1917. The background was a history of strong growth in revenues and a continued buoyant market for office equipment. IBM was not alone in sharing in the growth of the time. In 1886, William Burroughs had formed the American Arithmometer Company to manufacture and market adding machines. These were targeted mainly at the banking sector where Burroughs had gained his experience. After initial slow progress, sales began to pick up and by the early part of the 1900s the company was selling over 4,000 units a year, with sales doubling every few years. In 1906 the company’s name was changed to reflect its founder and called the Burroughs Adding Machine Company. Adding machines represented a growing business, but the adding machine with the greatest practical impact, and hence the largest sales growth, was the one that assisted with day-to-day transactions, the cash register. National Cash Register (NCR), the company that had grown to service this demand, became the corporate giant of the time and introduced a range of selling practices which were to become a major influence in shaping the developing industry.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The financial statements of American Arithmometer which sold Burroughs adding machines and later changed its name to Burroughs show clearly the early growth of the industry. The product was a precision-engineered machine and a market-leading product. Sales growth was strong and the firm’s balance sheet was initially adequately capitalised, meaning that recourse to outside financing was not required. Strong growth and product leadership meant that premium prices could be charged, allowing a net income margin that rose from over 20% to nearly 50% at its peak. Margins of such magnitude would not be sustainable in the long run as the key technology was not patent-protected. Nevertheless, there was sufficient protection to allow these margins to be sustained for a ten-year period. As a consequence there was a level of cash flow that more than covered any costs of expansion and still allowed a strong and rising level of dividend payment. Even with the dividend payment, cash built up on the balance sheet, leaving the company in a strong positive net cash position. This is revealed in the closeness between the returns earned on equity and assets. That shareholders’ funds almost equalled total assets reflects the accumulation of profits on the balance sheet rather than any dilution, and hence – as with, for example, Standard Oil – the buildup in value for shareholders would be revealed in the advancement of book value which more than quadrupled over the ten-year period. One would therefore have expected a total return from investing in the company somewhere in the 30–40% range. The annual reports also show that the supportive environment that had allowed such returns to be generated was beginning to fade. The rate of growth in sales was slowing, margins were contracting and as a consequence the return on assets and equity was falling. Absent some new technological shift or additional line of business the expectations for future returns would necessarily be lower than what had been earned in the previous ten years. To the extent that the share price was predicated on a continuation of previous growth and returns, there was a strong chance of disappointment.</span> </p>
