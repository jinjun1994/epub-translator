<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Meanwhile, back in Britain a series of inventors – notably Charles Wheatstone and William Fothergill Cooke – saw their telegraph models installed by the railways. In July 1837, Wheatstone and Cooke ran a telegraph line along the railway track from Euston to Camden Town in London, and successfully transmitted and received a message down the line. The practical application of these early two-needle telegraphs was greatly enhanced by the standardisation of signalling introduced by Morse’s new code system. The Morse code’s great merit was its simplicity, something which widescale adoption of the telegraph demanded. The British government played a key role in the expansion of the telegraph system in the UK. Unlike the US Congress, it quickly recognised the strategic importance of the telegraph, and its capacity to replace existing semaphore-based transmission mechanisms.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Notwithstanding the early successes of Wheatstone and Cooke, the railways were slow to spot the potential of the telegraph. They also had concerns over its cost. It was government pressure that forced the introduction of the telegraph on a meaningful scale. While the commercial potential gradually became clearer, it remained a business that the railways regarded as peripheral. The need for traffic signalling made the telegraph indispensable for all railroads, but it was not an important source of revenue in the early stages.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There were some who recognised the power of fast information transmission. For example, in 1851 a historian of the English railways commented:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“For the highest and the lowest this simple power is alike beneficial. It purchases; it sells; it equalizes prices, it destroys monopoly; it places the poorest tradesman on a level with the wealthiest speculator; it renders commerce healthier; and it possesses that which it has been said distinguishes most modern discoveries, it is as free to the peasant as to the prince; as open to the mean as to the mighty; it is controlled and controllable by <span id="anchor_1211_78"></span>all.”<a href="ch51.html#anchor_1509_0">²³</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Far-sighted words, but ones which clearly were in a minority.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The European model was slightly different to that of Britain. In Britain, the Regulation Act compelled private operators to do the government’s bidding, but in countries such as Prussia, France and Austria, the telegraph was a state monopoly from the outset. The telegraph was quickly recognised as an important tool in national security. In Britain, for example, it was used to assist rapid deployment of troops during the period of revolutionary fears involving the Chartists. It also became an important tool of commerce. London financial prices were disseminated by telegraph from 1846 onwards. Ownership and control of the telegraph largely coincided with that of the railways; for example, the chairman of the Electric Telegraph Company was also the chairman of the North Staffordshire Railway. Although the public had right of access, there was pressure on government to regulate the telegraph to avoid potential abuses. At first, the regulation took a form similar to that which governed the railways. The Telegraph Act, passed in 1863, gave the Board of Trade some authority over the companies. By 1868, however, there were moves to grant the Post Office a monopoly. These were prompted by public reaction to a proposed price rise by the telegraph companies. This was seen as the companies exercising monopoly power. It threatened (among others) newspapers, which were by this time dependent upon the telegraph for rapid information transfer, a development which made possible the growth in national newspapers.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The government authorised the Post Office to purchase existing telegraph facilities. The offers were sufficiently generous that the railways did not oppose nationalisation. While the Post Office took over the operation of the telegraph, a third of the telegraph entry points remained in railway stations. The change of control led to a rapid growth in the service, which continued until it was eventually supplanted by the telephone. The expansion of the telegraph in the UK can be seen in figure 3.1. The number of telegrams sent trebled in the ten years from 1870 to 1880 and doubled again in the decade to 1890. As the telephone’s impact began to be felt in the last decade of the century, the growth in traffic began to slow and in the early 1900s slipped into decline.</span> </p>
