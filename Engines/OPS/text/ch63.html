<h1 id="anchor_1671_0"><span class="style1">Propaganda and confidence</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Edison continued a press offensive on the success of his work on electric light and its enormous potential. At the same time, he was working feverishly to try and overcome the technical obstacles with which he was faced. It was an extremely taxing time for him since the work pressure was combined with his own illness and an extremely difficult pregnancy for his wife. If this was not enough, one of his rivals, a gentleman called William Sawyer, visited Western Union and contended that he had progressed further than Edison in terms of improving filament technology. The board was sufficiently concerned to suggest that Sawyer’s patents should be bought out, a suggestion which raised Edison from his sickbed in fury.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Although Edison decried the efforts of Sawyer, he did admit that he had not researched the work done by others. In order to allay the fears of the board, a researcher called Thomas Upton was hired to investigate any potential threats from existing patents on electricity and incandescent lamps. Upton reported that what Edison had done was indeed new, even if various components drew on existing knowledge, and that Edison alone had understood the critical role of high resistance in creating a filament that worked. Despite this endorsement, the growing cost of Edison’s research worried the directors sufficiently to make them ask for a further presentation before more funds were committed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The importance of maintaining confidence with a powerful and convincing presentation was not lost on Edison, and he put on a performance of theatrical proportions, which led to a new contract for Edison himself and the release of new funds. The technical component of the presentation consisted of two lamps; the first a modified form of the Jablochkoff Candle. The second used a spiral of non-fusible metal as the filament. In other words, the presentation relied on Edison’s persuasive skills rather than on an active demonstration of technological advancement. The fact that his audience was financiers, a group of people not typically blessed with in-depth knowledge of technology, undoubtedly helped. Edison continued to raise expectations through the use of the press.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The scientific community was less impressed. Much of what Edison seemed to be saying was contrary to established wisdom. Experts like William Siemens, for example, said: “Such startling announcements as these should be depreciated as being unworthy of science and mischievous to its true <span id="anchor_1679_45"></span>purpose”.<a href="ch68.html#anchor_1888_0">³⁶</a> There were damning rebuttals of Edison’s claims by other contemporaries. “[That the] same wire that brings the light will also bring power and heat”, said one, was “sheer nonsense” and indicated that Edison had the “most airy ignorance of the fundamental principles both of electricity and <span id="anchor_1679_92"></span>dynamics”.<a href="ch68.html#anchor_1889_0">³⁷</a> The criticism from the scientific community stemmed in part from pique and also from Edison’s habit of making grand unsubstantiated announcements through the press rather than through formal scientific avenues. The cutthroat nature of the race to be the first to announce advancements no doubt also contributed to the vehemence of the attacks. Nevertheless, aspects of the attacks were accurate: Edison probably did not understand, in a pure scientific sense, some of the fundamental principles as accepted at the time. This ignorance was a substantial contributor to his refusal to accept the impossibility of certain things which his experience suggested to him could be achieved. Edison himself said many times that for this very reason he had been saved from the dangers of accepting such ‘impossibilities’. Edison’s faith in his own ability to solve problems sustained him, and his confident manner would sustain investors through such attacks.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">History records that Edison was eventually successful in confounding his critics and developing the electric light bulb. It also records that the Edison Electric Light Company was eventually merged with other Edison concerns to become the Edison General Electric Company, which itself merged with the Thomson Houston Company to form General Electric (GE).</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Edison had to resolve two issues for the incandescent lamp to be successful. Firstly, he had to overcome the problem of filament combustion. That is, the filament material’s melting or combustion point has to be well above light-producing temperatures. He did this through innovation in both the glass-blowing and vacuum-forming processes. Secondly, he had to come up with a dynamo or generator suitable for powering the system of lamps. It is in this latter area that Edison was overtaken. It was not that he failed – he did successfully produce a direct current generator that could power his lighting system. Rather, he was overtaken by George Westinghouse, who adopted an alternating current (AC) system able to distribute power over longer distance with less leakage and hence much more efficiency. Whether powered by genuine concerns over safety or by an inability to accept that an alternative system could be better, Edison resisted adopting the AC system until it was effectively forced upon him. It is interesting that Edison, who continually proved that through perseverance practical problems could be overcome – most notably expressed in his famous quotation: “Genius is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration” – was unwilling to accept that this dictum might also apply to others.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Edison began the search for a suitable electric generator by attempting to adapt the one developed by William Wallace and used in the demonstration of arc lighting that Edison had disparaged. Edison initially primed the press with the statement that with “[f]ifteen or twenty of these machines recently perfected by Mr Wallace, I can light the entire lower part of New York <span id="anchor_1690_63"></span>City”.<a href="ch68.html#anchor_1890_0">³⁸</a> Sadly Edison was wrong in this public assertion. Within three months, he was informing the same newspaper that every problem had been solved with the lamp and the only remaining issue was to find a viable power source – the Wallace generator having proven ill-suited. Eventually this problem was seemingly overcome when Edison’s laboratory built or replicated the work of two Philadelphia scientists (Elihu Thomson and Edwin Houston) to solve the main generator problems. In resolving the practical problems and getting to a stage where commercial contracts in 1881 could be entertained, Edison had spent well over $130,000 (or $10m in current terms). And this was only the research process. The development part was only just beginning and this would prove just as tortuous as the initial stages.</span> </p>
