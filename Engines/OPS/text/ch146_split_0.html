<h1 id="anchor_3854_0"><span class="style1">Apple and the search for a user-friendly machine</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The ‘new’ kids on the block were now Apple and Commodore. The former was the product of a partnership between a former Atari computer games programmer named Steve Jobs and the Hewlett-Packard engineer Stephen Wozniak. In his time at Hewlett-Packard, Wozniak had seen his proposed small computer rejected because of the uncertainty as to its potential customer base. Both Jobs and Wozniak attended the Homebrew Computer Club in Menlo Park, California, and witnessed firsthand the excitement generated by the Altair. The club was frequented by an assortment of hackers, engineers and others interested in computing. Wozniak had already put together a crude small computer as an improvement on the Altair. With the excitement generated by the growth of demand for Altairs in 1975, Jobs and Wozniak decided to harness their combined talents and produce their own personal computer.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The first edition was targeted directly at the kind of users who comprised the Homebrew Club. The machine, named the ‘Apple’, was based on a Mostek 6502 chip and fairly rudimentary. The ‘computer’ was effectively simply a circuit board which could run BASIC. There was still no keyboard, screen or power supply. A fellow Homebrew member, Paul Terrell, ordered 50 units to retail through his new computer shop. Terrell was only willing to stock fully assembled computers in his Byte Shop, forcing Jobs and Wozniak to somehow complete 50 machines within the 30-day credit period that suppliers were willing to extend based on the Terrell order. Somehow the work was completed within the allotted period and roughly 200 computers were sold, retailing at $666, a price reflecting the black humour of the proprietors. The initial Apple partnership included a former Atari service engineer named Ron Wayne, but following the frenetic activity associated with the Apple I, was reduced to Jobs and Wozniak when Wayne tendered his resignation and received $800 for his partnership share.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Work on a successor to Apple I began immediately. Unlike the first version, the Apple II was to include features that would make it appeal to more than the experienced or enthusiastic hobbyist. Firstly, it would be in a box. Secondly, it would be integrated, with a power supply, keyboard and screen included. Finally, it would have BASIC and colour graphics software. There was nothing revolutionary about this development. Many others in the field were also seeking to move down this path. Few were to do so successfully. In the mid-1970s the industry remained chaotic and unprofessional.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For Apple, the big break came from Jobs’s association with Atari. Jobs approached the head of Atari and was put in contact with a prominent provider of capital in California, who in turn referred Jobs to Mark Markkula. Markkula had retired from Intel in his thirties, after its success turned his stock options into financial self-sufficiency. He had worked with both Fairchild and Intel, and with his background in engineering was fully conversant with the properties and potential of the microprocessor. More important was his commercial background in marketing at Intel. After meeting Jobs and Wozniak, Markula decided to devote part of his time and financial resources to backing the new concern. At that time, the capital of the embryonic Apple Computer Company was almost non-existent. Markkula injected nearly $100,000 ($290,000) for a third of the company’s equity, and promised to inject a further amount to bring his capital commitment up to $250,000 ($730,000). Markkula quickly recognised the need to bring in professional management to shepherd the idiosyncratic Wozniak and the evangelist Jobs.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Unlike many of its competitors, Apple was not only to survive, but to make the list of the 500 biggest companies in America. Fundamental to this success was the development of the Apple II. This computer was a wholly different proposition from its predecessor, which had little to distinguish it from the other rudimentary, often self-assembled kits, whose purchasers needed to possess the interest of a hobbyist to put up with the effort required to put it together and to be satisfied with the limited tasks it could complete. Unlike the calculator – an easier, more efficient replacement for the slide-rule – the early personal computers did not replace anything. They only began to do so when they became easy to operate and had freely available software capable of performing the applications to which they were suited.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The key requirement for the successful personal computer was ease of use. This meant it had to be sold pre-assembled and contain all the fundamental elements from keyboard to screen. There also had to be software available which would expand its audience beyond those who viewed the PC as a challenge to include those who might see it as a practical tool. These two ingredients were augmented by an intensive marketing campaign, which preceded and accompanied the launch of the new computer and was designed to have both technical and aesthetic appeal.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Apple II was completed and launched at the West Coast Computer Faire in 1977. As the product gained public recognition, sales began to increase, but serious problems still faced the nascent company. Firstly, since it had a different operating system from CP/M, which had effectively become the industry standard, existing software would not run on it. Secondly, it suffered from the input problems of its counterparts. Just as Ed Roberts had seen the need to move to a disk-based storage system, so did Markkula at Apple. Unlike MITS, though, the necessary software was written in-house by Wozniak rather than contracted out to a third party. As a consequence, Apple had its disk storage capability much more quickly.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">So far as software was concerned, this was to come to Apple’s aid simply by chance. The chance in question was that the individuals who were to write the software liked the capabilities of the Apple computer and as a consequence wrote their software to work on the Apple operating system. The software was developed by two alumni of the Harvard Business School, who perceived the need for financial forecasting software. The two individuals, Daniel Fylstra and Dan Bricklin, were not the first to see this need. They were, though, the first to build such software for a personal computer and to do so in a manner that closely replicated how calculations were actually performed. The concept of a calculator that incorporated the characteristics of a mouse and a screen became the vision of Dan Bricklin as he worked on a series of painstaking calculations. His challenge was to translate the concept into a practical working example.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Bricklin borrowed an Apple computer from Dan Fylstra, proprietor of the Personal Software company. Eventually the concept was translated into a rudimentary working example by Bricklin and his friend Bob Frankston. With this achieved, a deal was struck with Fylstra. The authors, who formed a company called Software Arts, would receive roughly one third of the gross wholesale revenue with Personal Software as publisher retaining the balance to cover expenses and profits. The software was to be given the abbreviated name of visible calculations, or ‘VisiCalc’ for short. The software was demonstrated to Markkula, who gave it a decidedly unenthusiastic reception. Despite his vision for Apple, Markkula completely underestimated the importance of software for Apple sales. Undeterred, VisiCalc was launched through Fylstra’s company, Personal Software, in 1979. The first advertisement appeared in</span> <span class="style1">Byte</span> <span class="style0">magazine in May that year. In addition to his interests in Personal Software, Fylstra was also one of the founding editors of</span> <span class="style1">Byte</span><span class="style0">. At the same time, VisiCalc made its first public appearance before the industry press at the West Coast Computer Faire. The following month, it was demonstrated in New York City. The response to the initial presentation was muted; as the makers later recalled, the audience consisted of roughly 20 people, of whom 90% were either friends or family. Of the remaining 10%, they (both) left early on discovering the topic was not what they had expected.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Still, the response was not wholly disappointing. The business community showed sufficient interest to give the group hope. Moreover, at least one member of the financial community sensed the product’s importance. Ben Rosen, then an analyst at Morgan Stanley, waxed lyrical about VisiCalc. He pointed out the product’s capabilities and its ease of use, finishing with the quote: “So who knows, VisiCalc could some day become the software tail that wags (and sells) the personal computer <span id="anchor_3874_77"></span>dog.”<a href="ch150.html#anchor_4083_0">⁹¹</a> He was proven absolutely correct. In many ways, VisiCalc was</span> <span class="style1">the</span> <span class="style0">application the market had been waiting for – an application that would transform the personal computer into a useful tool for the whole business and non-specialist community.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In December 1980 Apple became a listed company as some of the founding shareholders, including Xerox and a number of venture capitalists, reduced their holdings. A total of 4.6 million shares were sold at $22, a price which some commentators believed excessive. Indeed, the IPO was banned in some US states because it exceeded the guidelines for IPO pricing. The stock closed on the first day at $28.75. History records the gains made thereafter.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It has been estimated that up to 20% of the sales of the Apple II were effectively derived demand for the VisiCalc program. The spreadsheet program was soon augmented by the plotting and graphics capability produced by Mitch Kapor and sold under royalty by Fylstra’s company, Personal Software. Eventually Kapor sold the rights to the software to Personal Software for $1.7m and struck out on his own to develop a full-scale competitor product. At that time the prevailing opinion was that software could not be patented and hence the leading business product was protected by licensing and copyright rather than by patent. This meant that there were no barriers to competitor products in terms of intellectual concept. Kapor was free to pursue development of an improved version of VisiCalc.</span> </p>
