<p><span class="style0">DEC had exploited the technology of integrated circuits with the PDP–8. In doing so, it provided a solution to the needs of a whole class of user. The market gap that it filled had been created by the industry itself. In economic terms, the demand for computing power was highly elastic – that is, highly responsive to price. Demand also responded to simplicity and product portability, but the initial reaction was to price, particularly price points that allowed the displacement of timeshare access to mainframes. This had been the secret of the success of DEC, but the logic of this success was not taken further by either DEC, IBM or any of their major competitors. The logic suggested a potentially enormous market for new products at cheaper prices, but it was not pursued.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The development of the personal computer market was therefore effectively left to chance and grew out of seemingly unrelated efforts in a somewhat haphazard manner. Unlike some technological advances, where replacement of existing methods was the target and hence the commercial yardsticks were fairly obvious, the story of the personal computer is more akin to the development of broadcasting as a by-product of the radio. The original intent of Marconi and other early pioneers was to replace wire-based one-to-one communication. The radio as a medium for broadcasting was recognised and developed initially by ‘amateurs’ before the potential commercial attributes became obvious and attracted existing media players to the market.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the case of the radio, amateurs required the improved productive efficiency and hence the lowered cost of valves to pursue their hobby. For the personal computer, a number of elements were vital for the market to emerge. Firstly, processing power and memory capacity had to be expanded and reduced in cost. Secondly, software had to be developed. Thirdly, peripherals had to become available at reasonable cost. These requirements were no different from those that faced producers in the 1950s and 1960s, but the difference was that they no longer needed to be supplied by a single company. This represented a sea change in the industry since the availability of capital – either corporate or through government contract – was no longer one of the pre-determining factors for entry. Capital was still important, but the scale of what was required was substantially reduced.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Intel, the company which became synonomous with the semiconductor or ‘chip’, was instrumental in making possible the development of personal computing. It emerged from work that was done by two other pioneering semiconductor companies, Shockley Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor. The ‘mother ship’ of the semiconductor industry was built in 1957 in Mountain View, California, and was the result of Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore becoming dissatisfied with the direction of William Shockley’s company. They were unable to persuade the principal financier of the merits of their vision of the future and found that their only alternative was to set out on their own.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Their first attempt to raise capital consisted of drawing up a list of potential companies that might conceivably have a desire to enter the semiconductor business. Led by the investor Arthur Rock, the investment bankers contacted all the companies on the list. The success rate was low. No funding was forthcoming; moreover, not one of the companies was willing to even see the group. The search was broadened, and eventually funding was provided by Sherman Fairchild and the Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation. On the back of its new semiconductor division, Fairchild was to become a huge commercial and stock market success. Its semiconductor operations rapidly proved successful, leading Fairchild Camera and Instrument to exercise its option to take 100% control in late 1959. That year the sales of Fairchild-produced semiconductors had grown tenfold. The years that followed demanded substantial investment in R&amp;D and production facilities, and Fairchild retained its lead as the largest producer of silicon transistors in the world. The company would continue to prosper with the impetus of this new growth area and the value of its shares on the stock market more than reflected this achievement.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The company’s commercial viability was sustained in the early years in much the same way as that of the other computer companies had been: by government contract. Fairchild benefited directly from the Cold War, supplying integrated circuits for the electronics of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Its first major contract was for the Minuteman project. The operations at Fairchild represented the cutting edge of semiconductor design and manufacture; as such, they effectively became the industry training ground for semiconductor engineers and entrepreneurs, who would hone their skills at the company before moving to join or set up competitors. Among the companies whose operations emerged in what became known as Silicon Valley were National Semiconductor, AMS, Teledyne, Rheem and Signetics.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">While many of these companies became important, the defining moment came in 1968 when Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore left to form Intel. For Noyce and Moore, Fairchild had become a frustrating place to work. A series of management changes had left them unable to control either their own destiny or the technological thrust of the company. Fairchild had become a victim of its own success. While it might have spawned an entire industry, its ultimate fate was to be a distressed sale to Schlumberger, the oil service and equipment company, in 1979, and after further decline, a further sale to National Semiconductor in 1987. Fairchild’s shares had been one of the top-performing securities of the period; its later decline reflected the decline in the company’s fortunes.</span> </p>
