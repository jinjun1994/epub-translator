<p><span class="style0">The business imperative for IBM was to make it cheaper for companies to replace old accounting equipment with new computers. In the early years, the decision to switch to computing implied the need for programming resources and a big change in working practices. IBM’s solution was to provide a total solution for the customer. In other words, it would provide both the hardware and either applications software (such as accounting or payroll packages) or a simple, easy-to-learn function which would allow the customer to do programming in-house. IBM had a massive customer base over which to amortise the cost of writing these applications and long practical experience of working with customers to allow them to do it. The 1401 was also launched with a much-improved printer, nearly four times faster than its predecessor. The logic for customers was compelling and the 1401 became almost an overnight success. By this time the structure of the industry was beginning to resolve itself both in terms of the number and identity of the participants and the segments of the market they were seeking to address. Effectively, however, it was IBM against the rest. The rest comprised a range of entrepreneurial start-ups, divisions of large companies in related businesses, and companies with obsolescent technology who were seeking some way of surviving.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">At this point, only two categories of company really counted for much. There were the manufacturers of computers and the suppliers of components. Software remained the preserve of the equipment manufacturers or their customers. Such was IBM’s dominance of the industry that its competitors had to make a decision which competitive strategy they were going to adopt. Since software was such an important issue for most clients, it was extremely difficult to persuade would-be purchasers to take the risk involved in moving away from IBM equipment. You either produced IBM-compatible equipment focused on a specialist niche where software was not an issue for the client, or you took on IBM across the board. Companies such as Control Data and later Cray took the niche route, supplying top-end powerful computers to technically sophisticated clients, capable of developing their own software anyway. Others such as Honeywell went down the compatibility route; the ‘200’ machine it launched in late 1963 provided almost four times the computing power of the IBM 1401 for the same price. This strategy was also adopted by RCA, which took the approach of waiting for the new IBM models to be announced and then seeking to produce a lower-cost version. Others, such as Burroughs and NCR, stayed with their own systems. They relied on their specialist expertise with their particular client groups, particularly in the banking and retail sectors, to retain their customer base.</span> </p>
