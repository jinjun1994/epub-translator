<h1 id="anchor_2986_0"><span class="style1">The Marconi companies</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Marconi had been the first to demonstrate the practical application of Hertzian waves, and from the start he had been singularly focused on the commercial applications of his work. His equipment was fairly rudimentary, attracting the criticism of the scientific community which at the same time resented the publicity he was receiving for success that they perceived to be technological backward steps. Marconi was impervious to such criticism. His approach was to seek out potential existing solutions and experiment with them himself. If this failed to overcome the obstacles he hired the necessary talent, most notably Fleming without whom success could never have been achieved. The commercial focus of his work had led him to negotiations in Britain to try and capture the Royal Navy, the world’s largest maritime customer. The frustrations and disappointments of his discussions for land-based communication involving the British-government-controlled monopoly had pushed his interests westwards to the United States.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Marconi faced the need to improve the technical capability of his equipment, the flaws of which his scientific critics were happy to point out, while at the same time ensuring that the news flow was sufficiently reassuring to keep the confidence of his investors. His business model might have differed from De Forest’s only in degree, but one essential difference was that as a matter of policy Marconi refrained from grandiose claims and maintained strict control over financial expenditure. Having said this, as the stock advertisement in figure 7.6 shows, there was little reticence in the financial projections he provided. For the record, the American Marconi Company did not make the profit suggested until 1913, and did not make a profit at all until 1910.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">Publicity before profits</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Despite Marconi’s establishment of an American subsidiary, and his frustrations in Britain, the company remained decidedly Eurocentric in its early operations. The press in America was assiduously courted, and demonstrations such as the reporting of the America’s Cup were treated as important marketing events, but the commercial structure was focused on Britain. Marconi’s frustrations in Britain stemmed directly from the attitude of the British Post Office, the GPO. The introduction to Preece, effected by Marconi’s mother, proved a mixed blessing. By 1900, the GPO had witnessed a rapid expansion in the number of messages carried on its system, from some 10 million in 1870 to 90 million in 1900. This had not prevented it from accumulating ever-increasing losses. The GPO’s financial position meant it could not afford to take a chance on any innovations. For example, it turned down the exclusive use of the Bell telephone in <span id="anchor_2994_148"></span>1877.<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3284_0">⁶⁶</a> There was also latent resistance from Preece, who had been conducting his own work on wireless transfer of information.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the early years, the GPO’s involvement with Marconi was driven as much by its desire to monitor his work as it was by the wholehearted support it professed in public. Eventually Preece made an offer to purchase the radio patents, but by this time Marconi had become disenchanted with the relationship, and decided that he could not trust the GPO any more as a partner. In part this was driven by the experience of a series of trials in 1897, where Preece required Marconi to give Adolf Slaby access to Marconi’s radio equipment at the behest of the German emperor. Slaby was able to return to Germany and replicate Marconi’s work, which in turn led to the development of the radio within AEG and the establishment of <span id="anchor_2996_129"></span>Telefunken.<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3285_0">⁶⁷</a> This was the backdrop to Marconi’s decision to accept the family-related offer of funding for his new company. So far as the GPO was concerned, there was a degree of muted disappointment, but this was tempered by the protection afforded by the British monopoly rights and the view that Marconi’s work was such that any patent issues could be avoided if it was necessary to replicate his radio.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">At its inception, Marconi’s company had sought to generate revenue by selling its equipment. The main potential client remained the Royal Navy and extensive trials were conducted using Marconi equipment. Eventually, as tensions rose – with hostilities in South Africa and the Boxer rebellion in China – the Navy finally shook off its hesitation and placed an order. Although initial orders were not large, they were vital. By 1899 Marconi was supplying both the British and Italian navies. The orders produced a capital injection of $6,000 ($2m) and annual income thereafter of over £3,000 <span id="anchor_2998_95"></span>($1m).<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3286_0">⁶⁸</a> Important as the financial boost was, more important was the recruitment of the largest navy in the world as a customer and the validation of the product that this conferred. However, the initial strategy of selling equipment proved misplaced. This was because it relied on the willingness of potential clients to fund capital expenditure to buy the equipment and support infrastructure at a time when its reliability and commercial, as opposed to military, application was far from proven.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">After two relatively unsuccessful years, the reality of the situation was recognised and Marconi changed strategy from direct sales to leasing. A new subsidiary was set up to provide service for a fee. Thus a client wishing to enjoy wireless communication would enter an agreement with the Marconi International Marine Communications Company. In return Marconi would provide a full service, including the equipment and an operator. Since the charge was for the period of the lease, and not for individual messages, there was the added benefit that some of the British government’s monopoly restrictions could be circumvented. Most importantly of all, since the equipment stayed in the hands of Marconi operators, it was possible to enforce a rule that only communication with other Marconi users would be allowed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The commercial logic of this was relatively straightforward in that it was the route to creating a monopoly or dominant market share. The application of this strategy was more difficult and required that Marconi secure an anchor client who would effectively compel other users to join the network. In the early part of the 20th century that client was Lloyd’s of London, the hub of the maritime insurance world. At the time, the British merchant navy accounted for half the total shipping tonnage and was five to six times the size of its nearest competitor, the American merchant navy. In 1901 Lloyd’s signed a 14-year exclusive deal with Marconi. With this agreement in place, it was now prudent for the company to establish the necessary network of coastal radio stations.</span> </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph Company</span> </h3>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The Marconi Company in Britain – to be precise, Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph Company – issued its initial set of accounts under the name the Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company Ltd. The company name was tied directly to the company’s objectives, which were to provide a wireless alternative to the telegraph. Unlike the US subsidiary, the British company was able to attain a sufficiently powerful market position to reach profitability within a relatively short space of time. The critical element in this, spelt out in the company accounts, was the agreement reached with the maritime insurance market of Lloyd’s of London on the compulsory carrying of Marconi equipment on vessels insured at Lloyd’s.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">This was the first stage in the development of Marconi. The UK parent company relied mainly on the income generated from maritime operations within the sphere of influence of the British Empire. Returns on investment were sufficient to keep the company in business, but were no more than respectable at best – with a return on equity that rarely exceeded 10% and a return on assets of barely half that. Growth in income over the first ten years was moderate at best, and little profit accumulated on the balance sheet, as the company deployed the revenue it earned to fund expansion and repeatedly asked its shareholders for additional funds. Returns were always running behind the cost of expansion.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style2">7.3 – Marconi: great inventor, average company</span> </p>
<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style0">British Marconi annual reports.</span> <span class="style1">Stock Exchanges London and Provincial Ten-Year Record of Prices and Dividends</span><span class="style0">, Fredc. C. Mathieson &amp; Sons, 1897 to 1931 issues.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The second stage in the Marconi story came when the overseas operations turned profitable. The most important of these was the American Marconi Company, which made no meaningful returns until its absorption of United Wireless. The acquisition of United Wireless gave American Marconi a dominant position in the US market. The UK parent company would undoubtedly have benefited from remitted income and dividends through its shareholding had not World War I intervened. Just before the war, income was rising and reasonable returns being earned. Since much of the equipment had been amortised, cash flow would have been positive and allowed expansion without recourse to outside funding.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The problem for the UK Marconi company was that when the war ended the US government forced it to sell its shareholding in the US subsidiary to GE and end any British influence on the company’s operations. As this took place just as the demand for radio broadcasting was about to explode, the return on investment for UK Marconi shareholders was massively curtailed. This might not have been so damaging if Marconi had been able to exploit the British radio market as RCA did in the US. Unfortunately, it had neither the patent pool protection nor the access to the nascent broadcasting industry that RCA enjoyed, as the British government extended public control of the postal and telegraphic networks to the airwaves.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The long-term returns on Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph Company were therefore relatively poor, given that it was the company which was at the forefront of the creation of a new industry. Converting historic income into today’s figures reveals a different picture to the one you get if you simply look at the historic numbers. On this basis it is clear that the earnings peak of the company coincided with the acquisition of United Wireless by Marconi’s US subsidiary. After that, the story was one of slow decline, a hugely disappointing result for investors, who must have believed that they had picked the right horse in a technological sense, and astutely avoided all the stock market scams and hype that surrounded other sections of the industry.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The overall conclusion has to be that without a complete monopoly, point-to-point radio operations were simply not a sustainably high-margin growth business. The high-growth business proved to be in broadcasting. Unfortunately the principle of public ownership in the UK prevented Marconi from participating on one side of the Atlantic, and government regulation aided by RCA prohibited it on the other. Investors in Marconi therefore had the unfortunate outcome of being largely excluded from an industry the company had helped to create. Eventually the company was subsumed within the growing electric conglomerate which was to become GEC, until history turned full circle and the Marconi name again appeared as a listed company in the UK until it was later sold to British Aerospace.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In 1901 Marconi had been faced with the debacle of the botched coverage of the America’s Cup. His response was to return to England to continue work on his transmitting station in Cornwall. Marconi sought an event that would overshadow the public scepticism stemming from such unfortunate events. The answer lay in the Atlantic. For years, the owners of the transatlantic cables had controlled the passage of telegraphic information across the Atlantic. The big users of this service bitterly resented the pricing power held by the owners. One of the biggest users was the press. When Marconi demonstrated that wireless transatlantic communication was possible, the reception as a consequence verged on the ecstatic, not least from his long-time supporter, the</span> <span class="style1">New York Times</span><span class="style0">. It did not matter that a station in Cornwall had only managed to transmit the letter ‘s’ to a station in Newfoundland. The result was everything Marconi could have hoped for: tumultuous praise from the press.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Again, the scientific community was critical, verging on the scornful, but this did little to undermine Marconi’s belief. Marconi’s problems in America stemmed not so much from a lack of publicity or any scientific concerns as they did from economic nationalism. Marconi was trying to create a profitable enterprise, and this was what drove him to try and exclude competitors. The policy of leasing equipment and barring communication with rival equipment was very similar to that operated by the Bell Companies for the telephone. By excluding competitors, it effectively tried to create Marconi equipment as the industry standard. The monopoly policy and the cost of leasing were both problematic for the US Navy. From a strategic perspective, to cede control of communication to a new monopoly based in a large competitor nation was not an obvious choice. Entering into long-term leasing contracts was also a problem as, in legal terms, the funding came in an annual appropriation. There was also simple prejudice, with Marconi referred to as part of a ‘Jewish cabal’ (notwithstanding that Marconi was Irish-Italian <span id="anchor_3034_178"></span>Catholic).<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3287_0">⁶⁹</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Despite his public success, Marconi’s business prospects were not easy to discern, which left the field open for entrants such as Fessenden and De Forest to gain the biggest market shares. De Forest was able to do this through his giveaway pricing policies and repeated share issues. It was equally difficult for Marconi in the European countries outside Britain and Italy. Germany, in particular, sought to have Marconi’s non-communication policy annulled, as the strategic importance of encouraging a domestic radio industry was recognised. Britain and Italy resisted this move, while America tended to support it. However, a conference called to discuss the matter was inconclusive, as the requirement for Marconi equipment to communicate with that of other operators had no legal force and existing Marconi clients therefore continued as before. The 1903 International Wireless Conference had been called ostensibly to promote ‘world peace’. The reality was that it was called to promote the interests of the German radio industry, as represented by Telefunken, a new company created out of the radio work of Slaby-Arco, Braun-Siemens &amp; Halske.</span> </p>
