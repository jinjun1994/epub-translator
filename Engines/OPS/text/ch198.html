<h1 id="anchor_5133_0"><span class="style1">Timeless lessons about technology investing</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The ten episodes of profound technological change that make up the basis of this research highlight a number of common themes. Each episode naturally has its own distinct features and no two episodes are precisely alike. But they all underline how difficult it is</span> <span class="style1">ex ante</span> <span class="style0">for investors to make rational or confident decisions about where and when to invest in an emerging new technology. So many variables are uncertain or unpredictable. Periods of speculative excess clearly create opportunities for short-term gains. These gains are the honey that lures so many investors into the high-risk trap of trying to pick the winners from a new technology craze. This is a game, however, that only the nimble can hope to win.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For long-term investors, the issues are less clear-cut. In many historical cases, while it might have been possible to invest in the winners at lower prices earlier in the cycle, the probability of success would still have been quite low. Consider if, for example, one had foreseen the future success of the railways. At what point would it have become obvious that excess capital had been diverted to the sector? Or that much of it had been squandered on poorly built or inappropriate lines, to say nothing of the amount siphoned away by fraud?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">To invest in the telephone one had to presume to greater foresight than Western Union, the dominant communications company of the day. On electric light one would have had (a) to go against mainstream opinion and not invest in arc lighting; (b) to go against public opinion and invest in incandescent lighting; but (c) only do so once the rationalisation of the various companies had taken place. At the time the question of which technology was going to win remained in the balance for some time.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The history of the automobile provided an even more nuanced choice. If by chance you had been able to identify the genius of Henry Ford at an early stage, it would have been important to wait until he had been bankrupt twice before investing in his third venture, the Ford Motor Company. Or, in the case of General Motors, you would have needed to twice avoid the acquisitive excesses of Durant. In the same way the investor would have had to know that the two existing technologies, electricity and steam, would fail to maintain their progress and be overtaken by the internal combustion engine.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For the personal computing age one would have had to wait for Apple to appear, but remembered to exit before Microsoft attacked the space; to understand the dynamics of IBM and the coming of Compaq, but be ready for the arrival of Dell! This would have meant ignoring hundreds of other competing companies that grabbed the headlines and market share during the early years. In the case of Apple, the investor would later have needed to decide when and how to buy back into the company’s shares in anticipation of the extraordinary success of the iPhone.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">With all of this in mind, the following are some of the general guidelines that I take from the analysis of past historical examples:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">1. Many big breakthroughs in new technology are derided when they first appear</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Far from being seen as potential transformers of economic or social life, many of the biggest breakthroughs in technology over the past 200 years have been initially greeted with hostility or condescension, even by experts who should have known better. The reason for this is that new technology by its nature threatens the existing order of things and in doing so creates a conservative reaction from incumbents.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The following contemporary quotations are just a few of many similar examples that could have been quoted:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">2. As a result, many pioneers of new technologies have to struggle in order to win initial acceptance for their inventions or breakthroughs</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There are many examples of this phenomenon. Thomas Edison spent years battling to convince a sceptical world of the merits of his incandescent lamp. Guglielmo Marconi had to do the same with his early work on wireless technology. In these and other cases, without favourable economic conditions, the pioneers of new technology have often needed to display huge amounts of fortitude and stubbornness in order to prevail. Anyone who has read James Dyson’s autobiography will recognise how this phenomenon has not entirely changed, despite the ready availability of venture capital and other funding sources. It is only in exceptional conditions that shortage of capital and scepticism suddenly cease to be an issue for technology pioneers. These periods are the exception rather than the norm.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">3. The inventors and pioneers of new technology are not always the best guide to what is going to happen</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Despite their persistence and stubbornness, many inventors and pioneers of new technologies fail to grasp the true significance of what they have found; and even when they do grasp it, are not always able to cash in on it, usually because of financial pressures. History records many examples of those who have been forced to sell the rights to their inventions at what subsequently proves to have been giveaway prices. Heroic failures are two a penny in the story of new technology. When radio first appeared, it was widely assumed that its main use would be for interpersonal communication, competing with the telephone, whereas in fact its real growth was to come through the development of broadcasting. Many Internet companies made a similar mistake, believing that the principal market was in B2C applications of physical products.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">4. New technology and overpromotion have always gone hand in hand</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Scepticism and shortage of funds demand industry pioneers sound confident at all times if they are to have any chance of finding the risk capital that they require. Overegging the potential of new breakthroughs is part and parcel of the territory of developing new technology. When an overpromoted concept reaches the stock market, this can easily translate into a bubble if market and liquidity conditions are receptive. This is what happened with Internet stocks, just as it happened earlier with railway companies (the 1840s), radio shares (the 1920s) and electronics companies (the 1960s). Investors who are promised the earth from a new technology invariably need to adopt a healthy scepticism, and to beware of arguments that ‘this time it’s different’ – what Sir John Templeton called the four most dangerous words in investment. When analysts dispense with traditional valuation criteria in order to justify prices that cannot be justified any other way, it is a ground for caution.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">5. Winning the technology battle is no guarantee of commercial success. Nor does the best technology always win</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In many cases, once a new technology has been demonstrated to work, it is followed by fierce competition from scores of rival producers to bring it into commercial production and viability. This inevitably lessens the possibility that investors can pick the eventual winners; and lessens also the scale of the returns that they stand to make even if they do successfully pick out the best technology. The winners of these competitive struggles are not always those who have the best technology, but those who can most clearly see the way that an industry or market is likely to develop. It is not clear whether Amazon necessarily had the best technology, but it is hard to argue that it did not have the vision. The path was clearly and unambiguously articulated by Jeff Bezos, and all contemporary accounts of Amazon point to his messianic zeal in driving the company to its position as the low-cost distributor with the highest reliability.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">A company that has the capability to implement the right market strategy can overcome the disadvantage of having technology which is not necessarily superior. Microsoft is perhaps the best-known modern example, but there are others. Microsoft has consistently been managed against a vision of the future that has proven largely accurate, but it has also been swift to react when its original thinking was proved wrong. However, Microsoft was unable to navigate the shift to mobile platforms successfully, suffering the ignominy of losing the dominant share of the mobile market to Google’s Android operating system.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">6. Insiders usually make the best returns from new technologies</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Many new technologies in the past have made plenty of money for insiders, but outside investors have fared less well. In part this may just be an issue of timing and the investment cycle. Sometimes it has been the result of false and misleading accounting, sometimes the result of a lack of equity in the treatment of different classes of investor, and sometimes simply the outcome of outright fraud of one kind or another. This phenomenon recurs time and again in past periods, though fraud and misleading accounting were inevitably more common in the early years, before legislation and effective regulators emerged to provide greater protection to investors. It is no accident that the railway mania of the 1840s was followed by improvements in company law.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">During any period when investors are willing to suspend rational valuation measures in order to chase short-term speculative gains, there will always be manipulation. Investors willing to suspend reality have always been simply too attractive a proposition for unscrupulous operators. The early railway companies, for example, all competed for investors’ capital by promising and paying high rates of dividend. As these dividends could not be covered by internally generated cash flow, the companies could only pay them by taking on large amounts of debt or by paying them out of capital. When this game was exposed, share prices in railway companies collapsed, never to recover.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">A different aspect of the same phenomenon is that of the Ford Motor Company. This was unquestionably the most successful of the early automobile companies. Thanks to the Model T, Ford was able to achieve and sustain compound returns to its investors of more than 50% per annum for nearly 20 years. Unfortunately, the company was so successful financially that it was entirely self-financing throughout this period. Only the initial investors who participated in its first fundraising in the early 1900s enjoyed the benefit of these returns (but note that this company was the third that Henry Ford started, the other two having failed). Companies without need for external capital by definition have no need to bring in new equity investors. These companies are, though, relatively rare.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This iteration of the Internet has been characterised by the length of time companies have remained in private hands through funding rounds. This has been facilitated by the success on listing of their predecessors such as Google and Facebook, but it has allowed them to avoid the financial spotlight and scrutiny which comes with public listing. It will be very interesting to see whether investors who enter at the later stages of their private ownership will reap ‘private equity’-type rewards on exit.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">7. Bubbles in financial markets require more than just a new technology</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As has been mentioned, other necessary factors for a bubble include some or all of the following: easy monetary conditions (typically low interest rates), a previous period of relative prosperity and calm, the emergence of an extensive and uncritical trade press, and a general climate of optimism and overconfidence. Bubbles boosted by favourable economic conditions occurred in the 1840s, the 1900s, the 1920s, the 1960s and the 1990s. The timing of the bubble has more to do with external conditions than the current state of development of the technology that is ostensibly the subject of the bubble. Ironically, one of the clearest lessons to emerge from history is that in almost every case the quality press warned about the dangers of the market bubble emerging at the time. These warnings were usually ignored.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In recent years the world has been characterised by an interest-rate regime where governments have deliberately and openly lowered the cost of money in an attempt to boost asset prices. It would be perverse to expect that this has not assisted the flow of capital to funding private companies.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">8. The only surefire way to make money from new technologies over any extended period of time is through monopoly protection</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Even with the most successful inventions, commercial success may be short-lived. Unless the companies involved have patent protection for their products, or are shielded from competition by powerful barriers to entry of another kind (such as a sustainably superior cost curve), the degree of effective competition is probably the single most critical factor in determining how profitable investment in new technologies is going to be. Above-average returns are often simply competed away. In some cases, companies may be expropriated by government (a fate that effectively befell Marconi in the United States after World War I) or fall subject to a takeover. In other cases, it can simply be a case of a new technology being superseded by a newer and superior successor (as happened with the canals and railways, and the telegram and the telephone). Whatever the reason, as a technology company without monopoly protection, excess returns can only be retained by continually reinventing oneself, with all the risks that this involves. These questions are evident even for companies that dominate today’s market capitalisation tables: can Apple continue to produce innovative new products with global mass market appeal? How long will Google be able to resist regulatory pushback against its apparent natural monopoly?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">9. All new technologies veer from capital starvation to capital surplus and back again</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In virtually every industry that has experienced rapid or far-reaching technological change, periods of boom and abundant capital have invariably been followed by phases of retrenchment, industry consolidation and recapitalisation. These are usually much better times for investors to buy into a new technology than at the time when it is most in demand, as prices are invariably much lower and it is possible to invest on more favourable terms. By the same token, periods of capital surplus are the ones when the worst excesses tend to occur. The high prices that can be commanded for risky businesses, and the presence of widespread media attention, are magnets that eventually lead to an oversupply of the commodity for which investors are clamouring. Eventually the pendulum will swing in the opposite direction and access to capital will again become more difficult.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">10. Understanding technology is a vital component of generating superior returns – but investing in early-stage technology companies is a losers’ game</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It is worth emphasising that most new technology companies are fated to be losers. It is a high-risk game, in which many are called but few are chosen. New company formation in the technology area is characterised by a high mortality rate and fluctuating market leadership. Successful companies do eventually emerge, but they are rarely the ones that appeared successful in the first flush. Often they are companies that failed in earlier incarnations and have been recapitalised to try again. Recessions act as very powerful filters in this process. Investors need to own the companies that successfully deploy new technology and avoid those that do not. This takes time to unfold.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">All new technology companies, however great their success over many years (or even decades), eventually become out of date and are superseded by rivals with new and better technologies. Those that have become losers rarely come back from the dead. One of the few exceptions to prove the rule was General Electric, which has successfully reinvented itself several times over the course of more than 100 years in business. Unfortunately one of its later reincarnations was to take on the characteristics of a bank – which did not serve it particularly well during the global financial crisis.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">11. Investing in new technologies is a high-risk business</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">What all these factors underline is that there is – and should be – a substantial risk premium attached to long-term equity investments in most new technology companies. The irony, of course, is that these risk premiums tend to fall, and are frequently eliminated completely, at times of fervent market speculation. In such cases, many companies reach the stock market that would not normally be able to do so.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There are many groups and individuals who make money out of technology booms both before and after companies reach the stock market. Those on the supply side, including the issuers and traders of shares, generally generate the more immediate and more certain returns. There is nothing wrong with seeking speculative gains, provided investors are comfortable with the real risks they are taking. The mistake is to believe that such gains can be anything but transitory for most participants.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Those without specialist knowledge of what they are buying need to display particular caution at such times. Investing in new technology demands a thorough understanding of the impact it will have, and also the patience to watch events unfold and pick the correct time to invest. This will be when the risk/reward profile is at its most attractive, not when everyone else is clamouring to buy the same things.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In aggregate, the evidence clearly shows that it is the</span> <span class="style1">application</span> <span class="style0">of technology – what you do with it, not how wonderful it may or may not be – that is vital. This typically takes time to emerge. History suggests that leadership rarely remains with so-called ‘first movers’, and even where it does, the investor who ignores reasonable valuation parameters does so at his peril. The typical result of ignoring the price of what you are buying is that even if you pick a subsequent technology winner, it may be at the cost of never actually making any money.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2><span class="style1">12. Spotting the losers is easier than spotting the winners</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In reality the losers from technological change are much easier to spot than the winners. Losing technologies often face insurmountable obstacles in reacting to their new competitors. Canals, for example, simply could not achieve the speed of throughput that railways could. The telephone allowed voice transmission, whereas the telegraph did not. Cars made horses redundant as a means of transport. The digital computer provided greater accuracy and speed than any analogue equivalent could achieve. Online retailing of branded products and the advent of price-comparison sites redefined the ability of retailers and service providers to segment their markets and benefit from differential pricing. As a consequence customers both flocked to online provision and offline suppliers saw dramatic price deflation. This left a trail of devastation through traditional retailers, from books to consumer electronics to travel and insurance agents. Accompanying this, the exponential growth in Internet usage that followed search and online sales created a data treasure chest for advertisers. The ability to more accurately target potential customers left the advertising revenues of offline media such as newsprint and magazine advertising on the wrong side of history as a secular shift to online gathered pace.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Once persuaded of the losers, investors should typically disinvest. This is because losers from new technology are usually consigned to a period of persistent share price underperformance, in relative if not absolute terms. Incumbents rarely find a way to adapt their businesses to the new technology that threatens their existence. The classic example is Western Union’s failure to buy Alexander Graham Bell’s patents on the telephone when they were offered. In the public markets merely avoiding the shares of long-term losers from new technology is a more reliable way of achieving excess returns from an investment portfolio than trying to spot the winners, which is a high-reward but low-probability exercise. Even if the ‘losers’ manage to adapt and survive, they typically have shed a large part of their value through the struggle.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It is hard to overstate the importance of this aspect of investing. Knowing that a technology or method of doing business is in the process of being replaced should be sufficient incentive for professional investors to focus on those companies most likely to be adversely affected. While trying to pick the winners from a new technology is something of a lottery, figuring out the probable losers is a more straightforward business, and every bit as important. It may not be as glamorous but it potentially has a more profound effect on the ability to preserve and grow wealth. It does, however, require imagination as well as hard-nosed analysis. Even now it seems extraordinary that a company such as Eastman Kodak, so prominent for so long, should have effectively gone out of business as quickly as it did once digital photography became a commercial possibility.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For the Internet, the pot of gold is the financial sector. Banks, whose position was underpinned by the need for a branch network to collect deposits, now find that in the digital world this asset which acted as a barrier to entry is effectively a liability. We are still at the very early stages but one should expect the next ten years to bring signifcant disruption to existing business models throughout the financial sector, not least because the other barrier to entry – trust – was severely undermined by the global financial sector. Other than to set up the bank account itself, how many millenials ever have reason to visit a bank branch? Different elements of the financial sector are at different stages of disruption but from insurance to banks to asset management, all will face threats that have hitherto not existed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The failure of Thomas Edison to create a battery which had enough life to sustain a motor vehicle resulted in over 100 years of domination for the internal combustion engine. The electrical vehicle might have been more efficient but it lacked range. The evidence is pretty clear that science has now grasped this nettle and the market share of 30% which electric vehicles achieved in the early 1900s will again be reached – and then surpassed. The impact of this is profound, not just for automobile manufacturers but for the entire industrial supply chain. The development of batteries also carries implications for the set-up and operation of the electrical-supply grid system and the economics of alternative energy sources. The cycle of technological change continues to roll on, challenging investors to understand and adapt to the new disruptive forces at work.</span> </p>
