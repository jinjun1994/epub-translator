<h1 id="anchor_4478_0"><span class="style1">A pioneering IPO</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">By 2004 Google was sufficiently large in staff numbers that the law required the company to file financial results to comply with US security laws. The company decided that with that level of public disclosure it might as well be listed. The downside of a listing was the impact it might have on the company’s ethos and creativity. To try and set the stage Brin and Page prepared a ‘Letter from the Founders’ for the IPO prospectus, which set out their view of the risks for investors and a distinctly unconventional account of how the company would be run. This lack of conformity also applied to the IPO process itself. The traditional route of using brokers for an institutional placing was rejected in favour of a ‘Dutch’ auction in which investors could bid for stock and the price would be set at the lowest level that cleared the market. One of the avowed purposes of this method was to avoid the post-IPO jump in share price which typically accrued to favoured large institutions that had enjoyed privileged access to the flotation. It also reduced the juicy fees for brokers and the goodwill accruing to those in the placing syndicate through placing stock with favoured clients.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">A cynic might have guessed that these beneficiaries would be less than enamoured with the process Google was proposing. The reception to the IPO was certainly lukewarm. To be fair, in part this was a result of the fallout of the TMT crash that had preceded it. Nevertheless, at the time only 30% of Wall Street analysts had the company as a ‘buy’, 60% a ‘hold’ and 10% a ‘sell’. To the uninitiated this may appear a reasonable level of support, but for professional fund managers a distribution such as this implies a healthy dislike for the stock. A number of critical articles were written about the auction process and how shambolic it appeared. In this particular case, sentiment was heavily conditioned by the experience of the recent collapse in tech stocks, which meant investors were not going to repeat their prior mistakes. They would not again overpay for an overhyped company! There was to be plenty of time to repent on this attitude as the company and its shares went from strength to strength.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style1">Google did not follow the pattern of other companies during the TMT boom and bust. Being privately funded at that time, it was not subject to the same financing issues as many of its competitors. In its early years it retained a singular focus on the development and continued evolution of its search engine, despite many in the industry seeing little intrinsic value in the search function. Initially it sought to license the product but met a less than enthusiastic response. Nobody wanted to pay for the functionality it was offering. As the Internet evolved, however, the value of the data to which it provided access became ever more apparent. Google realised that the process of searching revealed consumer preferences, and successfully exploited this to access advertising revenues. The superior quality of its product cemented its position as the leading search engine and this, combined with the exponential growth in users, placed Google at the centre of the shift in advertising from offline to online that accompanied the growth in Internet retailing.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Armed with revenue and profit growth, the company moved towards its IPO in 2004. Given the subdued equity markets, and its controversial choice of a ‘Dutch auction’ method, the IPO could hardly be described as overhyped, as most of the new issues of the previous bubble period had been. Much of the broking community was neutral or negative about the stock and this was echoed in the financial press. This was understandable given that the formidable competition in search included companies such as Yahoo and Microsoft. That Google would maintain its technological lead in these circumstances was far from obvious to the outside observer.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">As history now records, after its IPO Google quickly achieved and sustained a dominant market share in online search, and with it access to the accompanying advertising revenues. Its lucrative market remains subject to competitive attack but thus far the company has successfully anticipated and blocked off the most threatening avenues. For example, the purchase of YouTube and the addition of free services such as email and mapping have all contributed to the core objective of incrementally adding useful information while maintaining user engagement. The shift from desktop to mobile devices represented a dangerous threat to the company’s hegemony in search. Google incurred heavy costs to successfully protect its position by purchasing, further developing and then giving away the Android operating system to handset manufacturers. This was a time-tested strategy of embedding functionality in an operating system and followed historic examples such as Microsoft with Internet Explorer and Office.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The scale of returns that have accrued to shareholders since the IPO has been spectacular, but such has been the profit growth that Google cannot easily be categorised as a demonstrably expensive stock. Its growth is sure to slow as the move of advertising to the Web matures. Competitors for advertising dollars include not just Facebook and other social media companies but also niche competitors that seek to nibble away at individual market segments, though this is no different from the challenges facing any successful company.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">With the growth in the Internet fuelled by search and the rapidly increasing proportion of online transactions, Google has been at the epicentre of a secular transformation in economic activity. Google’s drive to create a superior search capability would not have been sufficient to achieve its later dominance. Supportive funders provided capital to allow a breathing space pre-revenue, enabling the company not only to survive but to benefit from the effects of the TMT stock market crash. One should also not underestimate the importance of its speed of response in adopting better search-advertising revenue models. The relentless drive of the company to broaden and deepen its offering through innovations (e.g. Google News) and acquisitions (over 200 of which have been completed, including YouTube and DoubleClick) is testament to the company’s ability to blend creativity with focus, a much harder task for a massive company than a start-up.</span> </p>
