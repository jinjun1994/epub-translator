<title>Success for the UNIVAC - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<h1 id="anchor_3519_0"><span class="style1">Success for the UNIVAC</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The UNIVAC proved a great success, undoubtedly helped by the publicity it received in correctly predicting a landslide Eisenhower victory at the 1952 presidential election. In 1952 Remington Rand also purchased the Engineering Research Associates Company (ERA) to advance its computer capability. ERA had been formed after the war by William Norris and Howard Engstrom, two naval engineers, to manufacture electronic cryptology machines and had moved into general purpose computing equipment. Remington Rand therefore found itself in a position where it had the leading technology in a market that was beginning to expand rapidly.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Competition certainly existed. IBM, for one, recognised its vulnerability to the new technology and moved a large part of its R&amp;D budget to combat the problem. Despite this, its rival to the UNIVAC was not available until four years after the first UNIVAC had been delivered. The UNIVAC retained its technological lead. IBM’s sales of its 701 and 702 machines survived largely because the unanticipated speed of market growth left Remington Rand unable to meet demand for the UNIVAC. The IBM machines were a stopgap measure to prevent UNIVAC dominance. Further models were quickly brought to the market and IBM began to close the technological gap.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The growing market attracted many other potential competitors. These included existing companies working in related fields, such as RCA, GE and Honeywell, together with spin-offs from defence companies including Computer Research Company from Northrop and Datamatic, a joint venture between Honeywell and Raytheon. The growth also caused the creation of a number of companies started by employees within larger groups who then split off to start their own operations.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The growing threat from IBM was not lost on Remington Rand, and it merged with Sperry in 1955. The problem for the merged company was that its competitive position was at risk from more than just technology. Sperry-Rand had not moved to integrate the sales and marketing of its ‘old’ punch-card technology equipment with the ‘new’ UNIVAC machines. It also lacked sufficient capital to fund all the various operations that it had acquired, and a consistent method of prioritising needs. Overlaid on top of this were serious cultural differences between the merged companies. In 1957 Norris left to form Control Data and in 1959 Mauchly departed to set up on his own again.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The financial benefits to be had from the company’s technology depended on the degree of patent protection. With the telephone, Bell had fought repeated battles to maintain his claims. Bell’s personal relationship with the patent attorney and his meticulous record keeping had been particularly crucial.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Unfortunately for Mauchly and Eckert, they received no such advice and as a consequence eventually lost their patent protection. Their first reverse came in 1952 when Remington Rand signed an agreement with IBM to cross-license technology that required IBM to make payments if patents were issued on the ENIAC and UNIVAC applications. IBM got the better part of the bargain. Then, in 1972, in a judgement over patent infringement between Sperry-Rand and Honeywell, the patents were overturned and Atanasoff was credited with the first electronic computer. Had Mauchly and Eckert paid more attention to the patent process, and been better advised on their submissions, they might have obtained the same protection that the Bell Companies achieved in the early years. The debate as to who built the first electronic computer still rages on, just as it does on the telephone. Whether it was Atanasoff, the scientists at Bletchley Park, or Mauchly and Eckert is largely irrelevant in an investment sense, because the main point is that as the new industry emerged the original entrants could not rely on patents to sustain their operations. As a consequence the battle came down to questions of technology, customer service and funding.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">World War II had caused a massive acceleration in the new technology of the computer. In Britain, Bletchley Park had seen the construction of the Colossus. In America ENIAC had been created, spawning EDVAC and subsequently UNIVAC. Other academic sites had been sponsored by the government to provide assistance with the war effort. At MIT, Project Whirlwind had been inaugurated in 1943 by the Special Devices division of the US Bureau of Aeronautics to produce a flight simulator. This project evolved to become a full-scale attempt to provide a real-time computing capability. The initial estimates of cost and duration were $200,000 and two years later these escalated to $8m (over $100m) and eight years. The project was only saved by the increased tension of the Cold War occasioned by the demonstration of Russian nuclear capability. The demands for a national air defence system produced SAGE, the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment, in which the computer from Project Whirlwind was an important element.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The commercial significance of this was that IBM was commissioned to take the machine developed at MIT and produce the system for the armed forces. The company was given both the technology and the funding for its future development. Both were important. It has been estimated that in the 1950s the gross revenue on the project was in excess of $0.5bn (nearly $4bn) and that nearly 20% of the IBM workforce was employed on the <span id="anchor_3535_76"></span>project.<a href="ch135.html#anchor_3646_0">⁸³</a> The project allowed IBM to bring its real-time capabilities to the forefront and directly provided the basis for the successful airline reservations system which was to be developed for American Airlines.</span> </p>
