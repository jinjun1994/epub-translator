<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The search for alternative methods of lighting to candles and gas encompassed a number of sciences. On the one hand there was the development of the incandescent lamp and electrical power supply; on the other, there were more mundane efforts to expand existing methods. While electric light would eventually take over the illumination market, by necessity it had to begin at the upper end of the market with large-scale lighting before it could move down to meet the needs of the household market. In the intervening period, before the full impact of electric lighting was known, others continued to explore the potential to improve existing technology. This rested in the chemistry of hydrocarbons and in particular the product known as kerosene.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The development of kerosene in the 1850s had allowed camphene and whale oil to be replaced as illuminants. In the early stages the spread of kerosene was inhibited by the lack of a high-quality lamp and by the scarcity of the raw materials for producing kerosene. The first obstacle was overcome relatively quickly with the use of lamps from Vienna, which utilised a glass chimney to reduce the emission of smoke and fumes. The second obstacle was ultimately down to cost; it was relatively expensive to obtain coal oil and refine it into kerosene. It was in finding cheaper alternatives to the use of coal oil that the entrepreneurs of the 1850s foresaw great profits. Widespread use of kerosene lamps required an abundant supply of kerosene, and demand for illumination was self-evident – the missing link was the supply of the raw material. As the combustible properties of rock oil were well known, could rock oil be used as a source for kerosene? If so, could be it be found and recovered in sufficient quantities to make it a viable proposition? The search was soon on.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In 1854, a group of investors headed by George Bissell, a New York lawyer, and James Townsend, president of a Connecticut bank, commissioned a report on the potential lubricating and illuminating properties of rock oil. The group commissioned Professor Benjamin Silliman, an eminent chemist from Yale University, to conduct the tests. Initial indications were encouraging. When Professor Silliman presented the group with a bill for $586 (nearly $80,000), however, it was much higher than the group had expected, and they baulked at paying it. It was only Silliman’s refusal to hand over the completed report and his threatened disappearance on a long trip that forced the investor group to make the payment. The report was worth the money. Silliman confirmed that rock oil was a hydrocarbon that could be heated and distilled into fractions, one of which was a high-quality illuminant. The report, and Silliman’s subsequent personal investment, enabled the group to raise capital and form a company, the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company. The company’s objective was to find rock oil in sufficient quantities to produce kerosene and thereby capture a share of the lighting market from camphene and coal-oil-based kerosene.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The knowledge of the chemistry of rock oil was only one ingredient in the future success of the venture. The presence of rock oil in Pennsylvania had been common knowledge for a long time. But were there commercial quantities, and could they be extracted in an economic manner? Bissell’s group hoped to adapt techniques developed in the extraction of salt to assist them in the production of rock oil. A number of other groups in North America had also hit upon the concept and were using salt-boring techniques to the same end. However, most of the commercial world remained highly sceptical, and many believed the plan was ill-conceived with no scientific or commercial underpinning. The sceptics also had reservations about the man chosen to lead the field trip to Pennsylvania. This was Edwin Drake, an out-of-work railway conductor, who resided in the same hotel, the Tontine Hotel in New Haven, as James Townsend. No doubt spurred by Drake’s stirring tales of his achievements (and perhaps also the fact that Drake still had a free rail pass!) Townsend appointed him to lead the search for rock oil.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Drake left for Pennsylvania preceded by letters of introduction from Townsend addressed to ‘Colonel’ E. L. Drake – a fictitious promotion designed to enhance Drake’s stature. In December 1857, Drake arrived in the lumber town of Titusville in the northwestern hills of Pennsylvania. The first order of the day was to establish title to oil land, a fairly straightforward task given the venture’s low credibility. The second stage was the critical one; this involved the use of saltwater-boring techniques to drill for oil.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the spring of 1858, Drake returned to Titusville from New Haven as the general agent of the newly formed Seneca Oil Company. He began digging by hand at an existing oil spring and quickly sent for funds to begin using the salt-drilling techniques. On receiving funds of $1,000 ($125,000), work began. Unfortunately progress was slow, held back by the unreliable nature of the drilling crews and their doubts about the plausibility of the venture. Through the winter of 1858, Drake concentrated on the construction of the steam engine that was to power the drilling. Then, in early 1859, with the assistance of a new drilling team – ‘Uncle’ Billy Smith and his two sons – he constructed the derrick and ancillary equipment. Progress continued to be slow, however, and the investing consortium eventually ran out of funds, leaving Townsend as the last of the promoters to finance the operation.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Eventually, in August 1859, Townsend himself decided to throw in the towel, sending final funds with instructions to Drake to close down operations. Happily this letter coincided with the first signs of success. On Sunday August 28th, after abandoning work the previous day, ‘Uncle’ Billy spotted a dark fluid on top of the water in the well. By Monday, when Drake returned to the site, he was welcomed by all manner of receptacles filled with the same liquid. A hand pump was attached and Drake was able to do exactly what his critics had said was impossible: to pump oil directly out of the ground. The area had begun the journey to its eventual christening as Oil Creek.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The news of Drake’s success spread rapidly and the prospect of instant wealth made the area an irresistible magnet. Property prices soared and the population swelled as oil prospectors poured into the region. George Bissell immediately travelled to Titusville and bought up all the land and leases he could lay his hands on. By late 1860, there were more than 70 wells producing oil in the area. The production of oil naturally spawned refineries. Within the same period 15 were established in the region, with a further five in Pittsburgh. Although oil was being produced at a relatively modest rate, somewhere around 0.5 million barrels annually by 1860, this was still sufficient to spell the end of the coal-oil refining business.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">By the end of the year, most coal-oil refiners had either switched to rock oil or gone out of business. Complete success was assured when the drillers began to hit flowing seams and production spiralled to three million barrels. Inevitably, given such a surge in supply, in the short-term prices dropped precipitously. These prices drove many producers into bankruptcy, but those who survived would become rich. While the low prices caused difficulties for the producers, they also made kerosene derived from rock oil highly competitive, driving out coal oil, whale oil and other illuminants. Added to this, the impact of the US Civil War restricted the supply of turpentine-based camphene from the South, and encouraged exports of oil from the North to replace foreign earnings from Europe which had been formerly derived from the cotton trade. Kerosene thus took a big share of the lucrative illumination market and was not to be displaced until Edison perfected the incandescent lamp. The eventual success of kerosene, though, did not come in time to save the investors in the Seneca Oil Company. Discouraged by the low oil price that their very success had caused, they sold out their leases and disbanded the <span id="anchor_1926_200"></span>company.<a href="ch80.html#anchor_2160_0">⁴³</a></span> </p>
