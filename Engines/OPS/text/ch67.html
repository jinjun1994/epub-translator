<h1 id="anchor_1794_0"><span class="style1">The industry consolidates</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Despite the publicity battle and Edison’s opposition, the advantages of the AC method were such that utilities showed an increasing interest in AC over DC. Westinghouse was not the only competitor who saw the advantages of AC supply. Thomson-Houston had also done extensive research and development work on the system. Indeed, Elihu Thomson had concentrated much of his efforts on ensuring that issues of safety were incorporated as a key element. Thomson-Houston stayed out of the public debate, however. Partly this was because, although its systems had been designed with safety in mind, many of its utility customers had not installed these safety features as part of an effort to reduce costs. Pressure on Edison to change his stance on AC also came from companies that had licensed Edison’s technology and were under competitive attack from Westinghouse and others using AC.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">At the same time as the pressure was mounting regarding the type of power supply, pressure was also mounting on the structure of Edison’s businesses. Edison’s investors had become increasingly uneasy over their lack of control over the profitability of their investments and the obvious lack of centralised direction of the different Edison concerns. These concerns included the Electric Light Company, which controlled the patents, the Lamp Company, which manufactured the incandescent lamps, and the Machine Company, which produced electric motors for both the railway and lighting concerns. This structure made centralised negotiation impossible and the lack of both financial and managerial efficiency was obvious. As a consequence, a protracted series of negotiations took place, ending with the consolidation of these businesses and the formation of the Edison General Electric Company.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The consolidation took place against the backdrop of the legal case regarding the Sawyer patent. Edison’s conviction that he would prevail made him push for the consolidation to take place quickly. Since a successful outcome of the patent case would push up the share price of the Electric Light Company (in which Edison was a small shareholder) versus the manufacturing companies (where he held a majority stake) it was important that it take place quickly so that Edison could maximise his personal shareholding in the consolidated company. In April 1889 the company was formed and Edison ended up owning 17% of the outstanding shares, as compared with the 10% owned by the Vanderbilts through Western Union. The main shareholder of note for the future, though, was J. P. Morgan.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The outcome of the court battle went in favour of Edison. Westinghouse, who had purchased Sawyer’s patents, had managed to have the suit held in Pennsylvania, his home territory, while Edison had as a witness the late William Sawyer’s brother, himself seriously ill and having his medical expenses paid by Edison. Accounts of the case suggest it could have gone either way. Although independently developed the lamp could have been seen as a derivative of Sawyer’s work. At the same time, Sawyer had been found to be less than truthful as to the origins of some of his work. The verdict, recorded in October 1889, followed the expert evidence of the time and went in favour of Edison. While this verdict established Edison as the inventor of the incandescent lamp, it did little to assist his position against Westinghouse. The pressure exerted on Edison, most tellingly from the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies, eventually forced a rethink and design work on an AC system began in earnest. During 1890 and 1891, conditions worsened. Edison became increasingly short of funds. The consolidation of the electrical companies had increased his capital at the expense of his income and caused him liquidity problems. He resolved some of these by quietly disposing of some of his stock.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The growth in the Edison General Electric Company had dramatically increased the need for working capital beyond what the existing capitalisation of the company was able to sustain. Finally, the summer of 1890 was also the time when Barings Brothers collapsed (for the first time), sending shock waves through the financial community and increasing the cost of capital for anyone who needed it. The result of all these forces was the move to consolidate in the industry and in 1892 Edison General Electric merged with the Thomson-Houston Company to form General Electric.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This merger solved both the AC question and financial issues. Discussions about the merger, however, took place without the knowledge of Edison and some accounts suggest he demanded that his name be removed from the new company. The new company was capitalised at $50m (or nearly $4bn in current terms) with Thomson-Houston management gaining the upper hand as a consequence of their greater past profitability.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This left two major companies in the field in the US, Westinghouse and General Electric. In the UK the General Electric Company (GEC) had been formed and in Germany the antecedent of Siemens (Siemens &amp; Halske). This structure was to continue for some time and the incumbent companies were able to gradually increase their profitability as their markets grew and the range of applications for electricity expanded. What was important for these companies was not simply their technological expertise but access to capital to allow them to roll out the necessary infrastructure to support their product. Moreover, during the 1890s, when economic conditions tightened, the companies with access to capital were in an immensely strong position as competitors, whatever their skills, found themselves unable to develop their businesses. At the time the support of one of the major banking houses, with J. P. Morgan pre-eminent among them, was vital for a business which had a tendency to consume capital and run short of cash.</span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">General Electric</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style3">The early years</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">General Electric was formed under the financial aegis of J. P. Morgan from the merger of the Edison General Electric and Thomson-Houston companies. To a degree this is reflected in the initial financial reports formed from the pooling of the two companies. As has already been seen from the reports of Edison General Electric, the balance sheet assets contained substantial prior cost which had been capitalised rather than being treated as ongoing costs and expensed through the income statement. This treatment is reasonable in the sense that some value should be attached to the asset being created, but it does carry dangers if the accumulated costs which are treated as representing that value fall short of what the asset ultimately realises.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The newly formed GE found it necessary to take a substantial write-down shortly after it was formed on these assets to better reflect the true underlying value. In the 1894 accounts, therefore, a $14m loss was recorded in the income statement due to the write-down in assets following the merger. The underlying trading position, though, was one of a small net operating profit. The lack of retained profits meant that the $14m was shown as an asset which was gradually reduced by ongoing trading profits until such time as it had been removed and the profit-and-loss account could be moved to the liability side of the balance sheet to become part of shareholders’ funds. Treating the write-down in this manner allowed the company to avoid reducing shareholders’ funds until such time as sufficient retained profits had been accumulated.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">In 1899, GE switched the profit-and-loss account to the liability side of the balance sheet and made a reduction in shareholders’ funds sufficient to leave the profit-and-loss account in a marginally positive position. Looking at this in another way, the profits recorded by the prior company were effectively only paper profits. In its new form GE required a number of years to unwind this position and as a consequence it was only at the turn of the century that the balance sheet was in a sufficiently strong position to reinstate the payment of dividends on an ongoing basis. For the investor in the early years, a lot depended upon the confidence one held in management’s ability to maintain the underlying business in a profitable position while strengthening the balance sheet. By 1900 this had occurred and the true growth of the business began to show through, with the returns on assets and equity on a rising trend. This rising trend, though, was only sustained in the early years and as competition increased both earnings and the return on assets declined. During the early period GE entered patent-pooling arrangements with Westinghouse on the electrical generation and transmission side of its business. The initial jousting between Westinghouse and Edison over the incandescent lamp and AC versus DC supply had given way to a more pragmatic approach, once it had been recognised that competition was leading to financial difficulties. The patent pools were also to feature in the absorption of the activities of American Marconi by the newly created RCA in association with GE and Westinghouse. For the investor, the agreements between GE and its principal competitors undoubtedly assisted profitability and returns since they acted not only to restrain competition between the participants but also as a barrier to entry for new entrants.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style3">The first century</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The business of GE steadily expanded beyond incandescent lighting to power generation and many related fields, including the sizeable ownership position in RCA, which took place at the end of World War I. Up to World War II, income grew at around 10–15% a year, after adjusting for inflation and general economic growth. The return on assets and equity fluctuated around the 10% level – a very strong performance, as befitting one of the global leaders in the age of electricity. Moreover, the growth was maintained without putting undue pressure on the balance sheet or the need for meaningful recourse to shareholders.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The post-war period is more difficult to analyse by reference to simple charts of income and returns. Sales and income continued to grow at a strong pace, but they did so against a backdrop of falling returns on assets and equity. The widening gap between returns on equity and assets suggested a growing use of debt finance to assist sales. The difficulty is that the company’s inclusion of its financing activities on the balance sheet meant that manufacturing and financing areas needed to be analysed separately. The detail was not something revealed in the annual financial statements. The global financial crisis of 2007 revealed the dangers of such financial engineering both in terms of balance sheet risk and in obscuring underlying profitability.</span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">Westinghouse Electric</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style3">The early years</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Westinghouse Electric had been one of the main long-term competitors to the Edison companies (subsequently General Electric). When GE was formed by the merger of Edison and Thomson-Houston, Westinghouse had been a potential alternative partner for Edison General Electric. The competition between the two had taken the form of high-profile battles over the patent position of the incandescent lamp and the best method of power supply. As the electrical supply and lighting market began to take shape, competition over patents was reduced by the formation of patent-pooling arrangements. The development of the business required heavy capital investment to allow the development of the physical supply infrastructure, and given these capital requirements it was important that competition was kept within manageable boundaries. Westinghouse Electric undoubtedly felt threatened by J. P. Morgan’s backing for GE. The Westinghouse financial statements in the early years make repeated reference to the need not to reveal anything to competitors. Given the number of years when figures were not released, and the level of detail when they were, this goal was probably achieved. It makes detailed analysis difficult. We do know that the company encountered financial difficulties of sufficient magnitude to require the injection of outside funds, as a result of which George Westinghouse lost control of the company he had created.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">In order to sustain its position, the company needed both equity and debt finance. The financial statements show that, even as sales were growing strongly, margins were contracting; operating margins fell and the cost of debt-service rose. Westinghouse followed the orthodoxy of the day with a very high dividend payout, a practice which in retrospect would have been better curtailed to avoid the buildup of debt, although whether this would have been countenanced by the investors of the day is another matter. Another way of viewing this is that to the extent that Westinghouse Electric sought to please investors through an inappropriate dividend payout, it eventually suffered as the financial consequences caused a recapitalisation, dilution and loss of control.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style3">The first century</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The short-term difficulties Westinghouse faced as a result of funding infrastructure and international expansion did not overly inhibit the company in the long term. The electrical supply and associated businesses were in long-term secular growth, from which the company was to prosper over an extended period. Out of its interests in electricity came a participation in the radio boom, through sales of radio sets and the creation of the first broadcasting station. The immediate period after the conclusion of World War I was not an easy one, with the company being forced to react to depressed conditions with a series of inventory write-downs. This, though, proved only to be a short-term problem. The boom of the 1920s was only curtailed by the Depression. Even with the devastation wrought by the declines of the early 1930s, the period up to and beyond World War II was one of fairly constant growth in income, fuelled by sales and operating margins which fluctuated around the 10% mark. The problems which were to beset Westinghouse in later years essentially stemmed not so much from a decline in operating margins as a deterioration in the financial position and the buildup of debt.</span> </p>
