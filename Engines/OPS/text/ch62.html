<p><span class="style0">Many strategic investors in the gas industry did not take such a sanguine view. The Vanderbilts, for example, had been heavily involved with Western Union, and had thus experienced at firsthand both the threats and opportunities posed by technological innovation. As well as their railroad and telegraph interests, they were substantial investors in gas companies. When news of Edison’s discovery reached them, they reacted quickly. On 25 September 1878 their business manager was dispatched to meet Edison and acquire an interest in this new competing technology. Within a month, a new company with a proposed capitalisation of $300,000 ($50.5m) had been formed. Edison was to receive $150,000 ($25.25m) in phases, in return for 50% of his interest. The Vanderbilt family made their investment through Western Union, so as to avoid undermining publicly their existing gas company interests. Edison received an initial tranche of $30,000 ($5.5m) on 12 October 1878. Undoubtedly, the manner in which Jay Gould had outmanoeuvred the Vanderbilts to acquire Edison’s patents on the Quadruplex telegraph was a factor in their speedy response to this title. Combined with the fall in gas company share prices, knowledge of Edison’s efforts reinforced the need to take appropriate steps.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The rapid incorporation of the Edison Electric Light Company can be seen as an urgent response by the financial world to the opportunities and threats of the incandescent lamp as an alternative form of lighting. It was symptomatic of the time that sentiment could be easily jolted by scientific progress (or the lack of it). While Edison was highly respected, and his is the principal name that history records, there were other eminent scientists who commanded a similar level of respect and who did not always agree with Edison. In contemporary accounts, Edison was admired less as a pure scientist and more as a “master mechanic”, or someone who “simply made practicable what other men <span id="anchor_1664_116"></span>invented”.<a href="ch68.html#anchor_1886_0">³⁴</a></span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">For Edison, the painstaking and frustrating work of development was only now beginning. He had two principal barriers to overcome. Firstly, he had to come up with a cheaper filament than platinum, one which demonstrated the same resistance to combustion as platinum did. Secondly, he had to devise an electric motor to run the lamps. He also had to maintain the confidence of his investors and the general public. The investors believed they were investing in a pretty much completed product. William Vanderbilt, for example, told his son-in-law Hamilton Twombly, the president of Western Union, “I understand all serious difficulties have been overcome. He has discovered the means of giving an electric light suitable for every means at a vastly reduced <span id="anchor_1666_122"></span>cost.”<a href="ch68.html#anchor_1887_0">³⁵</a></span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Edison might have sincerely believed in his ability to solve the outstanding problems, but there was no guarantee that his backer would not be scared into withdrawing support before a solution was reached. The simplest way to avoid the issue arising was to pretend that there were no problems.</span> </p>
