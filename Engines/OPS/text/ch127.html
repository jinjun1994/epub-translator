<p><span class="style0">The beginning of the new period was marked by the transition to the use of vacuum tubes rather than relays and ran contemporaneously with the development of Harvard Mark I. It was a route being pursued simultaneously by a number of different groups. In 1937 in Iowa a mathematician named John Atanasoff, assisted by one of his graduate students named Clifford Berry, began work on constructing a new computer. Atanasoff drew on his experience in building radios to make use of vacuum tubes as components to allow electronic rather than mechanical calculation. He also used his experience of number systems to arrive at the conclusion that only a binary approach would work. Putting these two streams of thought together, he and Berry built a small prototype which was completed in early 1939. The pressures of the American war effort caused the work to be abandoned in 1942, when Atanasoff took up a senior position with the US Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Washington.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The uncompleted Atanasoff Berry Computer (ABC) had drawn some attention from the scientific community, in particular from John Mauchly, then a member of the faculty of the Moore School of Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. The Moore School worked very closely with the US military in the mathematically intensive field of ballistics. Mauchly had become acquainted with Atanasoff through a conversation following a lecture Mauchly gave to a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, where the topic quickly became their mutual interest in the use of vacuum tubes in the construction of computers. Mauchly subsequently travelled to Iowa to meet with Atanasoff and discuss the properties of his ABC machine. This meeting, and the correspondence it produced, many years later formed the basis of a lawsuit about important patents in the development of computers.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Mauchly’s scientific interest had begun with the study of molecular action and like many scientists of the day he was frustrated by the lack of available computational power. He sought to address this by building prototype computational machines using neon and vacuum tubes and binary counters. He subsequently switched to the study of weather patterns, but found the limited research budget at Ursinus College restricted his study. In 1941, he left to join the Moore School. By this time President Franklin D. Roosevelt had declared a state of national emergency and a National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) had been formed to oversee the efforts of the academic and business communities. One of the most pressing mathematical problems of the time was the need to improve the computation of ballistics data. This was to involve cooperative efforts between the Aberdeen Ballistics Research Laboratory, MIT and the Moore School. At the time ballistics data was calculated using an analogue differential analyser, which used numerical integration to calculate the ballistic tables which gave gunners necessary information on trajectory etc., depending upon the firing conditions.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As the demands for increased accuracy and the volume of information grew, so the limitations of existing methods became more binding. The analogue machine was ultimately limited by its engineering accuracy, and the process remained a people-intensive one requiring scores of ‘human computers’. There was a crying need for a machine that could automate production of this information. The environment was therefore receptive to Mauchly’s suggested new computing machine. At the Moore School, Mauchly had teamed up with a young faculty member named J. Presper Eckert to discuss his proposals. The two scientists made a good team, and Eckert brought with him his knowledge of logic and mathematics. After much discussion, Mauchly made a proposal in a memo entitled ‘The Use of High-Speed Vacuum Tube Devices for Calculating’. Although the memo was lost for a period, it formed the basis of a new project sanctioned by the US Army in 1943. The project was to build an all-purpose electronic computer.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">While the army was receptive, the same could not be said of other parties. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where specialisation had tended to be on analogue systems, voiced outright opposition to the project. At the NDRC, opposition was encountered for much the same reasons. The NDRC was headed by Vannevar Bush, an eminent analogue scientist, and included on its committee two members of the MIT faculty and George Stibitz of Bell Laboratories, who had been working on electromechanical devices. The project was approved by the army in May 1943 with initial funding of $67,500 ($1m). The project name for the machine to be created was ENIAC, short for the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. The construction of ENIAC was a monumental task, involving a large team of dedicated scientists operating under the direction of Eckert. The machine was built from a series of interacting modules dedicated to achieving specific tasks. It was vital that there was a set of common standards to which all groups worked. By May 1944 the machine was operating and able to solve second order differential <span id="anchor_3472_182"></span>equations.<a href="ch135.html#anchor_3643_0">⁸⁰</a></span> </p>
