<p><span class="style0">The split in the market and IBM’s dominance was assisted by the barriers to entry associated with providing customers with a complete solution from software to peripherals. The costs to new entrants of filling these needs were prohibitive. As a consequence, the entry point typically took the form of addressing the needs of sophisticated customers who did not require the ‘complete solution’. The two major client groups in this respect were the academic community and the military. Frequently new entrants emerged from an association of these two groups. For example, Ken Olsen, who formed Digital Equipment Corporation with Harlan Anderson, had been involved in Project Whirlwind at MIT. DEC was formed in 1957 as a result of Olsen’s desire to move from theoretical demonstrations to practical applications. Funding of $70,000 was received from American Research and Development (ARD), one of the forerunners of the venture capital industry, which had been set up to exploit wartime technological advances. DEC could not compete head on with IBM and on ARM’s advice sought to first establish a beachhead in the sophisticated user segment of the market. The results would eventually be spectacular.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">DEC had begun by producing digital circuit boards for other manufacturers, but in 1960 it was able to put its first computer on the market. This was the Programmed Digital Computer, or PDP–1. By focusing solely on the processor, and ignoring peripherals, DEC was able to sell the PDP–1 for $125,000 ($800,000), a fraction of the $1m or more that would be required for a mainframe. The downside was that such a computer could only be successful in a relatively small market segment. The big breakthrough for DEC was the PDP–8 computer, and the first one to use integrated circuits. The PDP–8 was the answer to the bottlenecking problem faced by all users of computer facilities. Up to the time of the PDP–8, users typically had to compete for access and time on an IBM mainframe. They were in the hands of the administrators of the mainframe and set against other competing users. To a substantial group of potential customers, therefore, the PDP–8 represented salvation.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Whether by design or chance, DEC filled the latent gap in the market and created the minicomputer segment. Customers included academia and medium-sized companies. It was not long before there was sufficient software to accommodate the users. Despite its overwhelming dominance of mainframes, and the rewards which flowed from that, IBM was caught flat-footed. Within a short space of time, DEC had grown to be the world’s number two producer of computers. The simplicity of what DEC had done soon attracted other competitors, but by this time DEC had gone public, raising $8.25m (just over $50m) and looking to erect the same barriers to entry which had protected IBM from immediate assault. These included the development of peripherals, software and sales/customer support. The only problem was that customers had landed on the UNIX operating system developed by Bell Labs as their preferred choice. By this time the market had begun to segment. Large mainframes remained, but were now joined in the marketplace by minicomputers. Minicomputers were more than just slimmed-down versions of a mainframe at a cheaper price. They expanded the market and also increasingly encroached on the mainframe’s territory. What should have become increasingly evident was that the cost of processing power was on a sharply declining curve.</span> </p>
