<h1 id="anchor_4634_0"><span class="style1">…and a monster stock market bubble</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the late 1990s the stock market initially reacted to the Internet much as it had to other technological advances, particularly those that took place during periods of low interest rates. Curiosity led to enthusiasm and then on, through an escalating series of events, to a full-blown mania. A brand new communications and distribution channel with relatively free access, when combined with cheap money, proved to be a potent mixture that later morphed into the mother and father of stock market bubbles. As the stock market success of early participants increased, a bandwagon formed. Many of the early participants had products that were integral to the development of the Internet itself, whether these were physical items of hardware, such as routers, or enabling software, such as browsers and search engines. Because of the enabling nature of these companies’ products, they were able to experience rapid growth in turnover.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This growth in turn reinforced the growing enthusiasm in the stock market for the ‘new economy’, one that appeared to operate in a competitive environment and therefore had few inflationary implications. It was also largely knowledge-based and capable of cutting out large elements of cost in a way that it was thought companies in the ‘old’ physical economy simply could not. Since the new economy required little capital, but promised great returns, it was almost tailor-made for the emergence of financial sector exuberance. Moreover, it was new companies that were expected to create the wealth and new companies by definition are not already listed on the stock market. They required the services of the financial community to reach a wider investing audience. As noted many times before, when investor enthusiasm is on the rise, the financial system has never been slow in creating a new supply of whatever is in vogue.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Two business models in particular – one funded by advertising and the second involving direct retailing to consumers – attracted most of the early money. Neither was in practice quite as revolutionary as the stock promoters in the investment banks wanted investors to believe. The advertising-based business model, for example, relied on accessing advertising revenues through the provision of entertaining or valuable online content. Effectively these ventures were merely an online replication of traditional media propositions and ones that in the boom period offered what was mostly inferior content. In an interesting twist, capital was also raised to create websites and services which were then heavily advertised to attract visitors, in the hope that they would in turn attract advertising revenues in the future. Such a circular model – advertising so as to get more advertising – lacked sustainable long-term growth prospects. In the short term, however, as in all bubble environments where the focus is on share-price gains rather than on business fundamentals, the absence of tangible signs of profits could be put off or ignored in anticipation of future growth.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">To be clear, it was not that an advertising-based model was incapable of producing sustainable revenues, it was just that in the evolutionary phase it lacked genuine competitive advantage over historic print-based incumbents. The long-term winners from the Internet revolution in advertising were to materialise only some time later, well after the stock market crash. By then more sophisticated market research models could be used to determine and exploit consumer interests and behaviour.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The other main initial business model that investors initially latched onto was the Internet’s potential to revolutionise the business of direct retailing, where the promise of a superior cost advantage was expected to allow an army of new suppliers to undercut existing retailers. The incumbents, struggling with the need to maintain and operate physical assets and with customers who also (in the US) had to pay local sales tax, appeared to be at a huge disadvantage. While Amazon, the most effective newcomer in the retail field, for sound business reasons selected books as its main initial product, the stock market willingly embraced a host of other companies in the B2C sector for which the model was less appropriate. Many of the sectors that Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos initially avoided as not being viable, were able to find willing suppliers of capital in the febrile atmosphere of the period. The main precondition for new ventures to obtain funding appeared to be the speed with which a stock market listing could be achieved.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">From a stock market perspective, therefore, while capital flowed from investors to newcomers in broadly the right direction, its targets were often poorly specified. It was clear that some kind of revolution was taking place, but exactly what the Internet would mean for individual companies and sectors proved difficult to determine. What was undeniable was that there was meaningful and sustained growth in Internet usage, whether measured by the number of users, the number of domain names or the number of new websites. The latter two measures in particular experienced exponential growth, not the more linear growth of user numbers, and this was an important factor in reinforcing the belief among investors that they were witnessing a genuinely revolutionary new phenomenon.</span> </p>
