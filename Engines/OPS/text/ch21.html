<title>Heroes and villains - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<div style="width:100%;height:14.375000000000002px;"></div>
<h1 id="anchor_682_0"><span class="style1">Heroes and villains</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Not surprisingly, as usually happens in such booms, new popular heroes emerged. Of these, the most famous by far was George Hudson. Hudson had married into a relatively wealthy family drapery business. He had also been left a sizeable fortune by an elderly relative. He lived in York, and was a prime mover in two ventures. The first was a joint stock bank, the York Union Banking Company, which was opened in 1833. The second was the construction of the York and North Midland Railway. Competition for the railway route was fierce. The railway would connect the coalfields of Yorkshire and the general industrial base of the North to ready markets in London. Hudson’s advantage was that he had assiduously courted interested parties and also had access to funds of the newly created bank. In the technical arena the masterstroke was probably allying himself with George Stephenson, the leading figure in railway technology, and the engineer who had built not only the Stockton to Darlington Railway but also the successful Liverpool to Manchester line.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">At the time, all joint-stock companies required approval by Parliament. Hudson helped one of his supporters get elected as Member of Parliament for York. He was subsequently questioned by a Commons committee about allegations of bribery. Hudson successfully ensured that the necessary bill was shepherded through the House of Commons and then through the Lords (after payments were made to an aristocratic landowner to ‘compensate’ him for the line passing through his estates). Hudson followed up his success by arranging to have himself elected Mayor of York, from which position he liberally dispensed largesse to the great and good of the city. Although Hudson came in for trenchant criticism from opponents, as long as the share price continued to rise, his popularity remained high. This was undoubtedly assisted by his partial ownership of a number of newspapers which he acquired for precisely this purpose.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">To retain the confidence of his investors, Hudson’s railway company paid substantial dividends. In 1840 he declared a dividend of 6% of profits, ignoring pertinent questions about the company accounts from some shareholders. Hudson’s practice was to charge a number of revenue items to the capital account, which had the effect of increasing profits (and hence dividend capacity) at the expense of the balance sheet.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The apparent success of the railway meant little attention was paid to such questions at the time, though there were enough clues in the published figures to raise suspicions, despite the absence of auditors and other controls on accounting manipulation. Hudson’s quest for profitability also led him to cut costs, potentially impairing safety.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Despite these faults, he clearly understood the economics of railways. His objective was always to create as near a monopoly as possible. He also saw the need to gain control of the main arterial routes through the country, which he achieved by acquisitions of other, less successful, railways. Through the early 1840s Hudson acquired a series of ever larger rivals. Their investors turned to him in the hope that he would return them to profitability and dividends. In many cases, Hudson actually</span> <span class="style1">guaranteed</span> <span class="style0">to do just that. Such was Hudson’s apparent success that he eventually gained control of nearly a quarter of all the railway track in Britain. He became known as the ‘Railway King’, was elected a member of parliament and had discussions with figures such as the Duke of Wellington, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Such was the success of the railways that more and more new lines were proposed. In order to maintain some semblance of order, the Board of Trade set a deadline of 30 November 1845 for all new plans to be submitted. Riots broke out as more than 800 groups of promoters sought to reach London on time. Roads were blocked as coaches vied with each other, and existing railways refused passage to their new potential rivals. As with many dot-com companies 150 or so years later, few of these proposals for later lines rested on rigorous analysis of their revenue-generating potential. Few investors attempted to calculate whether revenue would exceed costs by a sufficient margin to provide an adequate return on invested capital. Such was the environment that the scrip shares issued on companies immediately went to a premium, providing instantaneous paper returns. The parallel with the IPO boom of 1999–2000 could not be clearer. The scramble for new lines more or less marked the peak of the railway bubble, just as the 3g mobile phone auctions marked the peak of the TMT bubble.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The lure of quick and easy gains was irresistible, not only to the investing public, but also to promoters of new issues, at least those willing, able and fast enough to obtain approval in Parliament to launch a new joint stock company. Existing railways understood the dangers associated with the massive increase in new track and hence competition. They lobbied hard in Parliament against the creation of new companies, but with limited success. A further factor that contributed to the buildup of a frenzy in railway shares in the mid-1840s was the general improvement in economic conditions. This in turn created the conditions in which interest rates could fall.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As a consequence, noted one contemporary account:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“[T]he rate of interest had been gradually decreasing since 1839. From six per cent in August of that year, to five per cent in January 1840; from five to four, and from four to two-and-a-half per cent had the value of money fallen by September, 1844. Nor is it unworthy of notice that up to that point, while railway enterprise maintained a legitimate form, the rate of discount was four per cent. But when in that month two-and-a-half was the published rate, it was not long before a remarkable effect occurred in the general increase in all kinds of schemes and <span id="anchor_700_102"></span>speculations.”<a href="ch23.html#anchor_807_0">²</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“[T]here followed in the next few years a fever of railway speculation. Attracted by a bull market and the irresistible appeals of the financial press, groups of middle-class folk, who hitherto had never known the Stock Exchange, hurried to place their small accumulations in securities. The public funds and foreign government bonds were now eclipsed as the chief objects of speculation, and their brokers and jobbers were crowded out by the specialists in railway <span id="anchor_702_75"></span>securities.”<a href="ch23.html#anchor_808_0">³</a></span> </p>
