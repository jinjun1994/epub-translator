<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Until the 19th century, advances in number systems and computation had been relatively limited. Theoretical mathematics and physics had continued to advance, but the practical process of arithmetic calculations remained a laborious one. Indeed, little progress had been made from the abacus of biblical times.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The first major advance had come in the form of the slide rule, which in turn was underpinned by the elucidation of the principles of logarithmic calculations. These principles were first expounded by John Napier in Edinburgh in 1614. Napier had devised a system of logarithms that simplified the task of multiplication and division by using powers to convert the process into the simpler tasks of addition and subtraction respectively. This work was continued and improved upon by Henry Briggs, who produced an extensive book of logarithmic tables, but it was the invention of the slide rule by an English clergyman, William Oughtred, which enabled logarithms to fulfil a practical purpose. The slide rule was to survive as the principal calculating device for over 300 years.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This is not to say that more elaborate mechanical devices were not tried. Famous scientists such as Blaise Pascal and Baron Wilhelm von Leibniz constructed increasingly complex adding machines in repeated attempts to reduce the time absorbed by completing calculations. Despite their best efforts, the ability to test theoretical propositions empirically remained heavily constrained. Major assistance came from the use of logarithmic and trigonometric tables, based on standard proven relationships, the use of which helped to avoid the need for calculations. But the situation remained unsatisfactory and as the 18th century drew to a close the unfolding Industrial Revolution and the rapid development of the sciences placed increasing emphasis on the need to perform large calculations rapidly and accurately. The initial impetus though came from government and two of its perennial concerns: taxation and defence.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">An example of the first came in the late 18th century with the Napoleonic reforms following the French Revolution. Archaic structures and practices were to be swept away and replaced with a ‘modern’ system of government. A new decimal system of measurement was introduced and cartographers employed to help map France and contribute to a new and more equitable property tax, the dominant source of revenue. This was a time of the kindling Industrial Revolution and early attempts at specialisation, the division of labour that Adam Smith had highlighted in his recently published</span> <span class="style1">Wealth of Nations</span><span class="style0">. The computational work needed to produce logarithmic tables in decimal form was split into subcomponents and organised along factory lines. Unfortunately, after almost ten year’s work and with the tables nearly completed, the fiscal problems of the Napoleonic regime meant that publication and printing of the information never took place. The idea of segmenting the different tasks in calculation and using methods of differences to shortcut the laborious arithmetic work did, however, cross the English Channel to reach Britain.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The individual who promoted these ideas has become known as the inventor of the computer. Charles Babbage was born in Devonshire to a relatively wealthy family, where he grew up to develop an obsession with mathematics. In 1810 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, to pursue this interest. During his time at Cambridge, he was to learn firsthand the gaps in existing knowledge. In checking calculation tables used by the Astronomical Society, Babbage quickly discovered that the tables were riddled with computational errors resulting from human mistakes in computation, copying or printing. The errors tended to be compounded over time as subsequent tables used the existing body of work as their starting point.</span> </p>
