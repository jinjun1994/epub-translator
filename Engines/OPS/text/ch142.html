<h1 id="anchor_3730_0"><span class="style1">Economic imperatives</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The broadening to a more mass-market appeal that would underpin the success of handheld calculators arose not from the understanding of their latent appeal as much as the need to find ways to improve the economics of chip production by creating volume markets. At Texas Instruments (TI) in 1965, Jack Kilby, one of the inventors of the integrated circuit in 1958, put forward with two of his colleagues the suggestion that a handheld calculator be produced. The reasoning was that such a device would do much to broaden the appeal and demand for the integrated circuit. Two years later, in August 1967, a battery-powered calculator, the ‘Cal-Tech’, which could produce results on thermal paper, was produced. This signalled the start of a brand-new industry. The original impetus came mainly from the industry’s drive to produce complex circuits at low cost.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Texas Instruments was not alone in following this path. In 1968 Bill Hewlett asked his research staff to produce a pocket-sized calculator which could perform all the calculations of a slide-rule. The calculator was completed in early 1971, followed by the scientific calculator, the HP-35 priced at $395 ($1,400) in 1972. Meanwhile TI was negotiating with Canon in Japan for the commercial production of its prototype ‘Cal-Tech’, produced by Kilby. This was introduced as the Pocketronic in 1971, selling at $345 ($1,300). Thus arrived the calculator revolution, a revolution which seemed to take pace at whirlwind speed. The early profitability and mass-market appeal of a device which replaced archaic manual calculation devices attracted hundreds of competitors.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For Intel the attraction of the market was unavoidable. Its great need was to find a group that would finance the development of complex chips and guarantee volume production and sales. The new calculator market was not only a growing volume market, but one in which chip design was the key to success. Unfortunately for Intel, the main producers of calculators were already either self-sufficient in chips or had established relationships with other chip suppliers. As a consequence, Intel ended up in a contract with the Nippon Calculating Machine Company, a Japanese company which operated the Osaka factory for Busicom. Busicom had a number of business strands: on the one hand it imported computers and software from France to Japan. On the other it sold Busicom calculators to the USA on an original equipment manufacture (OEM) basis under the NCR brand.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Prompted and quietly funded by Sasaki, Busicom sought to enter the new small calculator market by developing a new calculator in collaboration with one of the few US semiconductor manufacturers not exclusively tied to a producer. The agreement reached in February 1970 reflected the bargaining powers of the two companies. In return for development finance and a guaranteed output volume, Intel granted the intellectual rights in the chip to Busicom. Article one of the agreement defined the minimum properties of the chip and article two assigned exclusivity on the chip to NCM or Busicom. Having obtained a contract for a processing chip, all that Intel had to do was design and manufacture one.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The development process was accompanied by headaches. The Intel chip designer, Ted Hoff, did not subscribe to Busicom’s detailed design plans. He felt they were out of date, and reflected thinking that had been superseded by technological advances, many of which he had had seen for himself through his work on the DEC PDP-8. He believed that Busicom’s plans would lead to a product that was overly complicated and too expensive to provide the core of a competitive calculator. He was correct, a fact that the Busicom representative graciously conceded.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">However, being correct in ascertaining the flaws in an existing design and being able to produce a superior replacement are two different things. Eventually, under the auspices of Federico Faggin, with the assistance of the Busicom representative Masatoshi Shima, a new improved chip, named the 4004, was produced. The 4004 contained more than 2,000 transistors and could perform over 60,000 executions a second. The new chip was still not viewed within Intel as a mainstream product, despite the fact that the funding from Busicom was vital to the company. Intel continued to concentrate its resources on the memory-chip side of its business.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Whether Busicom’s exclusivity contract devalued the chip’s commercial importance within Intel is a moot point. At the time the memory business was believed to be the main future profit centre. Microprocessors were little more than a sideline, a means to assist the sales of memory chips. Microprocessors were to become the cornerstone of the industry over the 30 years that followed, and so it is difficult to find too many of the early participants willing to admit their opposition to the development of that particular business with the company. It is clear that the potential of the microprocessor was not apparent at the time, and there was a great deal of unease about the amount of resources devoted to a product with no obvious market at a time when the sales environment was very difficult.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Uncertainty over the correct course of action ran throughout the company, up to and including the board of directors. Even when Busicom hit financial problems, and was forced to give up its exclusive rights over the new chip, it was by no means a unanimous decision of the board of directors to develop and promote the product. A division occurred between those wishing to stick to memory chips, and those who wished to pursue the microprocessor. The case for the microprocessor was helped by the argument that, should more be sold, it would inevitably increase demand for memory chips, the main product. As a note of side interest, the cost to Intel of regaining control of the 4004 chip was just $10,000 ($40,000). This only emphasises the lack of understanding of the potential for microprocessors. This was not to last long. Intel began to market the new chip in late 1971 and by 1972 the potential was becoming apparent, with both the technical press and customers displaying interest. Competitors such as National Semiconductor and Rockwell were also beginning to follow the same path.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The marketing concerns within Intel about the 4004 chip revolved around whether the size of the potential market for the microprocessor justified the expense and effort required to support it. The biggest effort needed was in the development of applications and the need to teach potential customers how to program these applications on the chip. By now Intel also had a second powerful new chip, the 8008, to consider. This chip had been developed for Computer Terminal Corporation, but had later been orphaned when CTC switched the contract to Texas Instruments.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">What the chips lacked most of all was a language to convert instructions into signals the chips would recognise and implement. In 1972, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in California named Gary Kildall wrote a language capable of taking instructions through an IBM 360 and translating them into commands for the 4004. Kildall was employed to produce a high-level programming language – PL/M – which could be applied not simply to the 4004 and the 8008, but also to a future family of Intel processors, should this eventually arise. Over time, Kildall’s efforts eventually turned into an operating system called CP/M. The future for microprocessors was still viewed with some ambiguity within Intel. This was demonstrated by the fact that Kildall’s request to sell CP/M on his own met no resistance and was not deemed to have any meaningful commercial <span id="anchor_3755_143"></span>significance.<a href="ch150.html#anchor_4081_0">⁸⁹</a> Even the pioneers who had backed their own judgement by creating a new company and a new product were unable to envision how the industry was to unfold. Kildall was also unaware how rapidly the industry was set to explode. In the late 1970s, exasperated by the work of running a commercial organisation, Kildall offered his partners his interest in the company, Digital Research, for $70,000. Within a few years of this offer, Digital Research had CP/M installed in over 200,000 computers and revenues in excess of <span id="anchor_3755_231"></span>$6m.<a href="ch150.html#anchor_4082_0">⁹⁰</a></span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">Intel</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The early years at Intel were ones of capital consumption as the company sought to produce new products. In 1969, for example, R&amp;D plus selling, general and administrative costs (SG&amp;A) amounted to more than five times gross revenues. In 1970, sales had grown tenfold, but although losses were still being made, any concerns investors might have had would have quickly dissipated. The rest of the 1970s were years of pretty much untrammelled growth. Moreover, the growth in revenues was not achieved at the expense of margins, which at an operating level consistently exceeded 20%. Net income also grew at a rapid rate. As a consequence, after the initial years Intel’s balance sheet showed none of the weakness frequently experienced with new technology companies.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">One reason was that Intel was a spin-off from an existing successful business, and its founders were pioneers of the industry. The technology risk was therefore minimal, the critical question being more one of commercial exploitation and the grasping of new opportunities. New opportunities certainly existed and the company attempted to exploit them, whether they resided in memory chips, digital watches or processor chips for calculators. The annual reports of the company showed that the microprocessor was not the main focus of the company in the early years.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Eventually the personal computer appeared and began to lift Intel to a new level of growth. Although growth had been rapid during the 1970s it had not always been smooth, reflecting the changes taking place in the industry and the poor underlying economic conditions. By 1980, the outlook for the company might not have looked as exciting as it had in prior years. Competition was increasing, and sales growth had slowed, bringing lower margins and reduced profits. The economic backdrop was one of high inflation and volatile interest rates. The reaction from Intel was to try to raise barriers to entry.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The company strategy had been based in part on timely delivery of product, but this was augmented by the use of litigation, as a defensive tool in reaction to copyright infringement, and as an offensive tool to scare away potential competitors. For possible new entrants, this was not an insignificant threat. Pure technological superiority was less important. There were numerous occasions where Intel managed to retain its market lead without having the leading product, not least in its battles with Motorola.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Just as competition in memory chips hotted up, the personal computer industry was about to be transformed by the introduction of the IBM PC. What followed was rapid and accelerating growth for Intel in microprocessors but gradual deterioration in the memory market. Intel’s supremacy had been usurped by Asian and Japanese producers, who produced better memory chips with lower wastage rates. Moreover, monetary conditions in Japan had fostered an environment where capacity expansion was no longer constrained by lack of capital.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The net result was that Intel saw a rapid decline in profits as competition increased and memory chip prices fell. The industry might have been a growth one, but this did not protect it from exposure to the economic cycle and fundamental supply-and-demand conditions. In the microprocessor area, IBM had required dual supply, as a result of which AMD obtained a contract to be the alternate supplier to Intel, a position ultimately led to costly litigation on both sides. In the mid-1980s, increased competition took its toll and Intel plunged into loss. For the investor, conditions would not have appeared appetising, with increased competition in most product areas on the one hand and higher capital expenditure requirements on the other.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">In practice, this difficult period presaged the beginning of another chapter in the Intel success story, with a move from PCs being branded to a situation where each PC box contained new branded products: the Microsoft operating system, Windows, and the Intel microprocessor. This shift was decisive in making PC production a commodity business and microprocessors a branded one. It is no coincidence that Intel stopped labelling chips by number and started giving them names. The growth of Intel was fuelled by the overall growth of the PC market, and enhanced by ever lower costs of production and the eventual expansion of the Internet and home computing.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">This is not to say that the industry’s cyclicality was removed. Indeed, for Intel, it probably increased, there being no hiding place for such a dominant supplier should there be a turn down in end-user demand. Furthermore, not only was Intel a proxy for the general condition of the personal computing market, the capital intensity of production continued to increase sharply, meaning that overlaid on cyclical sensitivity was a higher level of operational gearing. This means that in a downturn, the impact on profits will be very similar to companies in the traditional cyclical industries.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Not only has Intel become more cyclical, it has largely missed out on the growth area of mobility, allowing ARM to gain leadership. Moreover, it now faces the potential move to ever more specialist chip designs reflecting the growth in data science which flows from Internet usage and data collection. Increasingly data companies such as Google and Facebook are likely to want bespoke chip design. It is not hard to see Intel eventually morphing into primarily a chip fabrication business – highly capital-intensive, profitable but cyclical.</span> </p>
