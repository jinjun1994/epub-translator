<h1 id="anchor_3155_0"><span class="style1">The birth of broadcasting</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">One of the by-products of World War I was the creation of a US-owned corporation at the forefront of the radio business. Without government intervention it is unlikely that American Marconi would have been easily displaced from its position of strength. Just as AT&amp;T had survived the threat of the independents when its patent protection ran out because of the extensive network it had in place and the critical mass this created, so the Marconi network would have provided a formidable barrier to entry. In the aftermath of war, though, strategic interests were never likely to be subordinated. As a consequence, RCA was born.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The war also contributed to the development of radio in another way. During the war there was insatiable demand for those who could act as radio operators and many of those who filled this need were drawn from the ranks of the amateur radio community, many of whom used the medium to ‘broadcast’ messages to other enthusiasts. When they returned from the war they naturally sought to again engage in their broadcasting hobby. It took some time before the wartime broadcasting ban was lifted, but eventually it was removed in 1919 and interest levels began to again rise. The corporate sector was not to realise the significance of one-to-many broadcasting for some considerable time, remaining focused on one-to-one communication. Others were less constrained in their thinking. De Forest, whose prior commercial ventures had met with mixed success, certainly understood the potential for the radio as an alternative medium to newspapers and theatres for the transmission of information, sport and entertainment. De Forest had maintained the rights to use his audion for such broadcasting in his agreement with AT&amp;T.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">AT&amp;T certainly required the audion for the improvement of its mainstream telephony, but treated other potential uses with disdain. “To AT&amp;T, such broadcasting was frivolous, a hobby, and certainly not a pastime that related in any ways to its corporate <span id="anchor_3161_41"></span>goals.”<a href="ch116.html#anchor_3290_0">⁷²</a> This sentiment was commonplace at the time and bears an eerie resemblance to the rejection of the telephone by Western Union some 35 years earlier. Thus AT&amp;T spurned the patent rights for the radio. Unlike Western Union, though, the position was to be retrievable – and what was in danger of being lost was not its hold on an existing business, but a whole new industry.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The returning signalmen picked up their hobby with a vengeance and within two years of the war’s end there were over 10,000 licensed amateur broadcasters. These ‘amateurs’ were amateur only in the sense that there existed no broadcasting profession; they were certainly not amateur in their level of knowledge, and most sought access to the tubes which would allow them to broadcast on continuous waves rather than the intermittent signals of spark technology. There was a parallel with the differences between the telegraph and the telephone: spark technology could only transmit signals, like the telegraph; and continuous-wave technology could transmit the human voice, like the telephone. Another parallel – though it lay a considerable distance in the future – would emerge with the nascent personal computer industry, when large corporations left the field open to so-called ‘amateurs’ until they belatedly realised the commercial potential.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">One has to be careful not to exaggerate historic comparisons, though, since perhaps the most significant boost to the fortunes of the radio came through the activities of an employee of one of the major corporations. This was a Westinghouse employee named Frank Conrad, who had managed the production of Westinghouse portable wireless equipment for the armed forces during the war. Conrad returned to his amateur broadcasting after the war to find that his music broadcasts were enthusiastically received. Soon demand for portable wireless increased and Westinghouse recognised the potential for this new avenue of sales. To further stimulate demand, Conrad was instructed to complete a broadcasting station within Westinghouse premises and in November 1920, KDKA, the new station began broadcasting.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">These broadcasts had the effect of igniting a wildfire demand for the radio. Initially the newspapers generally ignored the phenomenon, a head-in-the-sand approach given that broadcasting was simply a different form of information and entertainment dispersal to the newspaper. The corporations involved in the manufacture of components did not, however, ignore it – GE, RCA and AT&amp;T set up their own broadcasting facilities. There was no single view as to its ultimate purpose, but nevertheless the broadcasting industry had been born. So far as the sale of equipment was concerned, RCA was the principal beneficiary through its patents, network and agency sales agreements for GE and Westinghouse products. The impact of the growth in radio and the difference from the early Marconi years is detailed in the analysis of American Marconi/RCA later in this chapter.</span> </p>
