<h1 id="anchor_464_0"><span class="style1">Questions raised</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The kinds of questions that I wanted to investigate were:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Could and should the bubble mania of 1999–2000, and the way that it developed, have been foreseen?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">What lessons could today’s investors learn from the history of the railways, from the way that the radio and electric light developed, and other episodes of epoch-making technological change?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Was it obvious at the time, for example, that a great company such as RCA would make as much money as it did, while its originally more successful parent Marconi produced much less impressive returns?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">What pointers from the past were relevant in deciding which (if any) of the pioneering companies of the Internet age – the likes of AOL, Amazon and Yahoo – were most likely to survive and prosper?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Do investors in aggregate stand to make money from technological changes? If so, what are the characteristics of the most successful companies? And can investors predict the eventual winners with confidence?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:3.75px;"></div>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">From a practical perspective, as the bubble started to burst spectacularly, it led me to wonder what pointers history provided as to how investors in this latest technology were likely to fare over the medium to longer term.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Should I have been buying technology shares in preparation for an inevitable rebound – or continuing to avoid them like the plague?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">If the latter, for how long should I expect to wait until the sector became investable again?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">How well would the winners and losers from this latest technological breakthrough do for their shareholders?</span> </p>
