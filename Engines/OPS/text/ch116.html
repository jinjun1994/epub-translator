<h1 id="anchor_3241_0"><span class="style1">Conclusions</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The technology of the radio was substantially less well-developed than that of the telephone at the time funds were raised. Despite this, radio companies found little difficulty in raising capital. The most obvious reason was the generally prosperous economic conditions of the time and the earlier stock market success of some emerging industrial companies. Whereas with the telephone, the depression of the 1870s and the accompanying bankruptcy of many railroads was still fresh in the public’s mind, in the early 1900s attitudes to investment were influenced by the resilience and growth that these industrial companies had shown after the recession of 1893. A period of six to seven years of steady profits growth and share price rises were fresh in investors’ minds.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Moreover, there were the profits of some other wonderful new technologies to be marvelled at. The growth of the Bell Companies under their protective patent umbrella, and their later transformation into AT&amp;T, made many investors regret the opportunities they had missed. Meanwhile, companies such as GE and Westinghouse appeared to typify a new kind of corporate potential, with their professional management and increasing influence. Investors viewed the future with confidence and were on the lookout for the ‘new Bell’. At the time, they could not have realised that even the mighty AT&amp;T had only earned the margins it had done because of the barriers to entry. Its profits had already peaked. Despite the fact that the industry would continue to grow, earnings per share would fall as competition intensified.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The radio therefore arrived at the right time. It hit a fertile market and prognostications about its long-term viability were to be proven correct. The long run proved to extend to more than 20 years and success when it came took a form that no one at the time had foreseen. Moreover, for the investor the choice of company to invest in would have been bewildering. Those who understood the technology might logically have been led to invest in NESCO under Fessenden, whose technology was superior to Marconi – but whose company ended in bankruptcy. A knowledge of the ultimate uses to which the audion could be put, and respect for the industry’s most visionary figure, would have drawn investors to De Forest. Their money would have been lost in the many nefarious stock manipulation schemes with which he was associated and for which he was subsequently penalised.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The ultimate ‘winner’ of the wireless race was American Marconi, a company whose ownership structure was effectively determined by the US government. This change in structure ultimately guaranteed its success, since in its efforts to create a national champion the government created exactly what it had in other cases been seeking to destroy, namely a monopolistic trust. The monopoly was created in an industry whose demand was ultimately to explode, though it was not to happen until the 1920s and only then in a direction – broadcasting – that few had foreseen and many were slow to react to. Putting this into a modern context, one has to imagine how the personal computer industry would have developed had a patent pool been formed at the behest of the Justice Department, to exclude new competitors and maintain monopoly margins so as to finance a move into broadcasting.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The lessons for the investor at the formative stages of the technology were expressed succinctly at the time by Fayant (figure 7.13). What he pointed out was that if a company had to rely on relentless issues of new stock to continue, and was unable to make sufficient profit to pay a dividend, then the only likely winners were the stock promoters themselves. This lesson is timeless and presents one of the most obvious parallels with the dot-com mania which seized part of the investing world in the late 1990s. The importance of dividends in creating value for stakeholders is evident in all long-term studies of stock market returns. Anyone wanting a vivid illustration of their importance need only compare the share price return of British Marconi with the total return including dividends. Fayant also pointed to the fragility and risk of a company which cannot generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend and depends for its existence on continual capital injections to keep it alive. Another lesson for investors concerns the importance and limitations of patent protection. For wireless investors, this lesson should have been evident in advance since it had been a constant feature in the development of the telegraph, telephone and electric light. Patent rights were vital in the development of the wireless industry, but not in themselves sufficient to guarantee success. Substantial financial backing and strong nerve were also required. Even when legally in the wrong, incumbent companies would seek to use litigation, cost and time as competitive tools with which to sustain their position. As a consequence, new entrants that lacked the necessary support could find themselves, as Fessenden and Farnsworth did, in a position where technical superiority did not bring the financial rewards that many would have expected.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The bull market of the period and enthusiasm it generated was not slow in alerting speculators to the returns which could be made. The excesses are vividly set out in a series of expose articles published in a series named ‘Fools and Their Money’ by Frank Fayant, published in</span> <span class="style0">Success Magazine</span> <span class="style1">during 1907. The articles are almost timeless in their content and should be read by anyone with an interest in the history of stock market speculation. Excerpts are set out below which relate to the general environment, but also to some specific examples.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“The man who has money to invest, and who rightly demands that it shall bring him a larger return than is made to him by the savings banks, wants to know what return he is likely to receive from investments in stocks of all these companies now offering their shares through all the newspapers all over the land …</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“How many of these companies, in the advertising of which the English language is drained of superlatives, are going to live and pay dividends? The same question was asked five years ago about a mass of new companies advertised with the same reckless use of superlatives. During the winter of 1900–1, the investors of the country went mad over stock speculation. The country was in full swing of an unprecedented era of commercial prosperity. Great industrial and railroad mergers, creating hundreds of millions of new securities, inflamed the public mind. The public invaded Wall Street, and went on a speculative debauch, culminating for a time in the Northern Pacific panic when the stock of a railroad only a little while before almost worthless sold at $1,000 a share. The mania for getting rich quickly through the speculation in stocks affected the whole country. The shame of it was that the debauch was led by men of standing in the community, who were intoxicated by their greed for gold … what has become of hundreds of companies brought out then?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">“To answer this question I have investigated every company that advertised its shares in the Sunday edition of the New York Herald in 1901 … During the fourteen months under review, the Herald’s income from this advertising was in the neighborhood of $175,000 … How many of all these one hundred and fifty companies of 1901–2 are making money today and paying dividends to their stockholders? One – just one! Just one of these one hundred and fifty companies which sold many millions of stock to the public is today paying dividends. It has paid two dividends of one per cent, each this year, and its stock is selling in the market at less than half what investors paid for it five years ago, although its promoters asserted that ‘it is doubtful whether anything has ever been offered to the public for subscription which gives so much promise for so small an outlay.’ ”</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The majority of the investments had ended in bankruptcy with only a very small number surviving. That there were now major industrial companies in the US which had survived the economic woes of the early 1890s and prospered was one of the foundations which allowed such scams to exist. The enthusiasm generated by success, and the examples of the GE and the Bell Companies, helped others to raise capital. It also lowered investors’ perceptions of risk and allowed less-scrupulous promoters to take advantage of the appetite whetted by the apparent potential. Effectively the investor was placing his or her savings in a concept rather than a business. In the case of radio, how would it have been possible to distinguish between rival companies and their competing claims? It would have been difficult enough to distinguish between which companies had as their principal motivation the raising of capital and which ones were genuine aspirants in the new technology. For many the question would have been subordinated in importance by the buoyant market conditions, which seemed to guarantee returns irrespective of the underlying fundamentals of the business in question. As the postscript by Fayant eloquently pointed out, commercial realities can be hidden for a period, but not ignored indefinitely.</span> </p>
