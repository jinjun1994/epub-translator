<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In 1848 Joseph Swan had successfully demonstrated the principle of an incandescent carbon filament lamp. An incandescent electric lamp produces visible light when its filament is heated to ‘incandescence’ by the flow of electricity. Unfortunately, the absence of a suitable power source and the inability to create the necessary sustained vacuum within the lamp meant that it was effective only as a demonstration. It was fully 30 years later – following two further inventions, the mercury pump (1865) and the dynamo (1871) – before Joseph Swan was able to demonstrate to the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Chemical Society a practical example of the incandescent lamp he had proposed so many years before. This lamp had distinct advantages over arc lights in that it did not carry the same intensity of light and was much more suitable for domestic purposes.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In 1879 Swan marketed his first lamp at 25 shillings each, equivalent to $500 today, and one year later applied for his first patent. In the US, Thomas Edison had followed a similar path. He filed in both the USA and the UK a patent on his incandescent carbon filament lamp. A dispute over patents in 1881 was eventually solved by merging the UK companies of the two inventors. The Edison Electric Light Company merged with the Swan Electric Lighting Company to form Edison and Swan United Electric Company. By 1881, improved production methods had allowed the price of the Swan lamp to fall, albeit to the still sizeable outlay of 5 shillings per lamp ($80).</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">While the incandescent lamp might have fallen in price and now represented the main threat to gas lighting, it was not a unified and obviously successful competitor. There were questions about the durability and cost of the lamp itself. An internal battle about the most suitable power source raged among its proponents. A layman would have had little chance of predicting the outcome to the debate; both sides had supporters who rank as historical figures in the field of physics.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the establishment camp, which favoured the existing direct current (DC) power source, were individuals such as Thomas Edison, Rookes Crompton and Lord Kelvin. Against them stood equally imposing figures such as George Westinghouse and Sebastian de Ferranti. The debate took place on more than one level. There was the scientific level with the presentation of papers to learned and august professional bodies. There was also a battle for public perception. As in any technology battle, the participants required constant injections of new capital. Without a perception of success, this capital was unlikely to be forthcoming, so maintaining optimism was vital. Luckily, this was something which Edison, for one, fully understood.</span> </p>
