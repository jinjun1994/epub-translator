<title>Rockefeller takes a grip - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<h1 id="anchor_1940_0"><span class="style1">Rockefeller takes a grip</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Rockefeller had recognised the need to expand the available markets for kerosene and to this end he dispatched his brother to New York in 1866. By this time, nearly two thirds of output ended up in the markets of Europe, with New York at the centre of the trade, meaning that prices were largely determined there. For example, European buyers in New York would hold back from making purchases if they heard news of new finds in the Pennsylvania oilfields, anticipating that this new supply would cause prices to fall. It was therefore one of William Rockefeller’s functions to appraise his brother’s buyers of price movements in New York to help protect them from such fluctuations. His other important function was to secure additional lines of credit on Wall Street, a vital feature for an enterprise in an industry so prone to boom and bust.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Rockefeller sought to ensure that the industry’s inherent instability was not compounded by any financial instability or stress within his operations. He therefore sought to minimise his reliance on outside sources of funding by building up his cash holdings and maintaining access to capital in both Cleveland and New York. This reserve was to serve him well, as it allowed him to take advantage of the frequent downturns in the market to acquire new facilities. The hiring of Henry Flagler in 1867, from Rockefeller’s previous partner Maurice Clark, was a key step – which reflected close ties through marriage with one of Cleveland’s wealthiest citizens, Stephen Harkness. Harkness had made a fortune during the Civil War profiting from inside information on future tax changes and was willing to advance Rockefeller the huge sum of $100,000 (nearly $8m) on condition that Rockefeller take Flagler on as a partner. Thus began one of the most successful combinations in commercial history. Flagler soon negotiated a rebate deal with the railroads that was to cement the future of the venture.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Crude oil and its refined successor, kerosene, have similar physical characteristics. They are both bulky and relatively homogeneous. For such goods, the cost of transportation is an important component of the overall price, and hence profitability. The raw material for kerosene, crude oil, had to be shipped in, refined into kerosene and then shipped to the end markets which could be many miles (and often continents) away. This meant the refiner had to be concerned not just about supply and demand, but also the cost of moving the product from one place to another. In the early years the teamsters who hauled the barrels from the oilfields were in a strong position, but their unreliability and notorious pricing soon forced producers to find alternative methods of transportation.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">So began the construction of pipelines. Eventually pipelines would become the dominant form of transportation, but for a period railroads retained a dominant position. The successful refiner had to negotiate with the railroads and confront their notorious practices. Rockefeller had positioned his refinery so that he had the choice of three main railroad systems and the Erie Canal. He was able to play them off against each other as he negotiated his transportation prices. This brought Rockefeller and Flagler into contact with the other giants of the day, men such as Jay Gould and Commodore Vanderbilt. Although fierce opponents in negotiations, all these parties were united in wanting the arterial route between Cleveland and the eastern seaboard to see off the competitive challenge of their counterparts in Pittsburgh.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In this they were unwittingly assisted by the Pennsylvania Railroad, which preferred to ship crude oil directly to New York or Philadelphia rather than to Cleveland and attempted to use its monopoly to achieve this end. Not content with this, the Pennsylvania Railroad also declared its intention to wipe out the refining activity in Cleveland and so secure effective control of the oil industry supply chain. For most producers in Cleveland this was a move that inspired panic. Many made immediate plans to relocate to Oil Creek in Pennsylvania. But for Rockefeller and Flagler, it was the opportunity that eventually allowed them to dominate the industry. The key was their understanding that the threat they faced as refiners and suppliers of goods to be transported was no greater than the threat the transporters faced themselves from rival routes. Recognising this, they were able to turn the situation to their advantage and negotiate a deal with Jay Gould which provided them with a majority shareholding in the Allegheny Transportation Company, the first pipeline out of Oil Creek. As a result, they were able to ship oil on the Erie rail system at a 75% discount to their competitors. They then used the negotiating power this gave them to arrange a 30% discount with Vanderbilt’s railroad, the New York Central System.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The key to these negotiations was Rockefeller’s ability to guarantee bulk supply, which gave the railroad operators higher utilisation rates and allowed them to consolidate shipments. This guarantee required Rockefeller to run his refineries at full capacity, which exposed him to the risk of sharp movements in kerosene prices, but the cost of this was small in relation to the overwhelming cost advantage the agreement gave him. His discounts were eventually to sound the death knell for most refiners. As kerosene was an expanding market, albeit an unstable one, the risk Rockefeller ran was ultimately an affordable one. There were physical as well as commercial risks to face, too, in the shape of frequent fires involving waste products in the refining process, which poured into adjoining rivers and were frequently ignited by passing ships. The waste product would in time come to be known as gasoline, a product that was to have an even greater economic value than kerosene.</span> </p>
