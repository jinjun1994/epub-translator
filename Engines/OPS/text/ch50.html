<title>Enter Theodore Vail - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<div style="width:100%;height:14.375000000000002px;"></div>
<h1 id="anchor_1401_0"><span class="style1">Enter Theodore Vail</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The increased demand for outside capital was such that the company was inevitably drawn into the sphere of J. P. Morgan, North America’s principal financier. By 1907, J. P. Morgan’s financial resources had become indispensable to AT&amp;T in its fight against the independents. It was perhaps inevitable that the company would fall into Morgan’s hands. In 1907 Morgan organised additional funding of $130m ($8bn) and attained control of AT&amp;T. Once in control, he appointed Theodore Vail to a new position of authority with the express goal of reducing costs and moving to a position of market dominance, preferably outright monopoly. Vail had resigned from the Bell companies in 1887 after failing to win the presidency of the parent group. Over the ensuing period, AT&amp;T ruthlessly built up its network and removed competition. The axis of Morgan’s control and influence over the availability of funding, access to the long-distance network and AT&amp;T’s competitive pricing was to drive many competitors into the arms of AT&amp;T.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Under Vail, the strategy at AT&amp;T remained broadly the same but tactics changed substantially. The market strategy was fairly simple: to achieve as close to a monopoly as possible by growth and acquisition, but also to seek to reduce prices in order to stimulate line usage and exclude new competitors. These tactics demanded that AT&amp;T become more efficient and Vail moved to reduce costs by eliminating duplication and increasing efficiency. One by-product of this drive was the consolidation of research activities into what later became the Bell Laboratories. It also involved the abandonment of a number of projects where returns were uncertain.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">At least one decision, to abandon radio-related research, was wrong. Nevertheless, Vail’s moves cemented AT&amp;T’s pre-eminent position within the telephone industry. In the early years, Vail’s principal focus was on attaining as close to a monopoly position as possible. His ambitions were not restricted solely to the telephone; in 1909, AT&amp;T acquired 30% of Western Union, much of it from the heirs of Jay Gould, an ownership position that granted AT&amp;T effective control of the company. This had profound implications, at least when combined with AT&amp;T’s refusal to allow competitors access to its long-distance lines. Vail’s argument for combining telegraph and telephone was that the two services were complementary rather than competitors, and that one company which operated both would achieve much increased efficiency. Vail also argued against the common perception that AT&amp;T was a trust, suggesting instead that by their nature telephone services were natural monopolies. In putting the case for the ‘natural’ position of telephone exchanges, Vail explicitly accepted the likelihood or need for some degree of regulation. Despite these arguments public opinion had turned and, fostered by the independents, it became clear that a battle was looming.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Vail understood the dangers inherent in confronting the government. His strategy was swiftly adjusted to face the new realities. AT&amp;T agreed to relinquish control of Western Union. Under the Kingsbury Agreement, the company also agreed not to purchase any more independent operators without first obtaining permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission. Finally, it agreed to provide access to its long-distance lines to third parties. The future for AT&amp;T no longer therefore included the attainment of a complete monopoly – political realities precluded this – but nevertheless, the strength of the company’s position made that particular goal unnecessary.</span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">The Bell companies and AT&amp;T</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style3">Early years</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The financial statements from American Bell and subsequently AT&amp;T reflect the nature of the company and in many ways are similar to those of Standard Oil. It was effectively a holding company with revenues that derived from its operating subsidiaries by way of dividends. Indeed, it was the inability to sustain this method of operation under Massachusetts corporate law which prompted the injection of American Bell into its erstwhile New York-based subsidiary in 1900. Examining the accounts of the parent company provides little by way of information on margins earned, since increasingly the revenue took the form of remitted dividends. In the early years the majority of income flowed from the rental of telephone equipment, but from about the turn of the century onwards the proportions changed and growth in income was effectively solely a result of the income from the Bell operating companies. What is more interesting are the balance sheet changes which were directly related to the changing conditions the company was experiencing and which directly contributed to the change of control and management.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">In the period from the company’s inception until the imminent expiry of the original patents, the balance sheet of the company was relatively unchanged. The high margins and increasing revenue were sufficient to fund expansion internally without increasing levels of debt or equity issuance. Although the number of shares outstanding more than doubled between 1880 and the early 1890s, they did so against a background of revenues which increased more than sixfold and net income which more than quadrupled. For the investor this was an entirely satisfactory outcome when added to a total dividend payout which had over the period exceeded the entire paid-in capital. Between 1881 and 1993, American Bell paid out over $25m in dividends against a paid-in capital amount on the balance sheet of $20m. It also retained on its balance sheet reserves of over $20m. For those investors who had been fortunate enough to take the risk of investing funds, the return from dividends alone would have been of the highest order, leaving aside the returns from the appreciation in the share price. It is worth bearing in mind that this is the business which Western Union could have owned for an outlay of $100,000. The benefits of a monopoly position in a growing business could not be more clearly reflected, but if further proof were needed the rapid growth in earnings per share shown in the chart provides it.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The increased level of competition that eventually ensued was evidenced not so much by the impact on net income growth as by the increasing recourse to external sources for funding. In 1893 the company had been in a position of zero net debt and this was broadly maintained through the early phases of increased competition. Net debt to equity did rise to roughly 30% by 1900 but this was reduced when the company was recapitalised during the switch to AT&amp;T. However, from 1900 onwards, as AT&amp;T embarked upon a more ambitious expansion through build-out and acquisition in an attempt to stifle the competitive threat, the net debt position rose year on year until in 1907 it reached a figure of 75%. That the balance sheet was able to sustain the debt increase was not a pressing problem as much as the deterioration in the returns to shareholders caused by dilution and the buildup in interest cost.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Despite the fact that the industry remained in a growth phase, earnings per share were falling sharply. The combination of falling earnings per share and recourse to outside capital culminated in a change in both control and management. In 1907 AT&amp;T had to raise over $130m in debt ($7.5bn). This brought the total debt on the balance sheet to $178m ($10bn). The fact that AT&amp;T continued to grow net income and dominate the industry should not detract from what investors would have experienced at the time, namely EPS halving and the share price behaving accordingly.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">From 1907, AT&amp;T redoubled its efforts to reduce the impact of competition. In the main this focused on acquisition by squeezing competitors both operationally and financially. The quest for monopoly extended to obtaining control of Western Union to broaden the services offered by AT&amp;T and increase the utilisation of its lines. Although income growth was coming at the expense of margin deterioration, AT&amp;T eventually came into conflict with the authorities over its degree of control over the industry. As a consequence, Western Union was disposed of at a loss less than five years later. AT&amp;T also removed the barrier to interconnecting the independents. For the investor these were profound changes. The fall in profitability could perhaps be explained by a marketplace that was in the flux of a consolidation phase. With the removal of all remaining barriers to entry, AT&amp;T was in the position of having to show more regard to service and pricing. Although it still enjoyed a dominant position in the industry, it no longer had the ability to make profits at the same rate as before. On the other hand, it did successfully avoid the complete breakup of the company which would surely have followed had it pursued its previous strategic goals. Whether this benefited the investor is an open question, given the experience of the breakup of the Standard Oil Trust.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style3">Longer term</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">A long-term analysis of American Bell (subsequently AT&amp;T) falls into three distinct phases. In the first phase, American Bell enjoyed the protection of the Bell and other patents. In the second phase, the industry was in a state of flux, as new independent companies competed with the Bell companies and franchisees. In the third phase, a degree of market stability finally prevailed. The difference between these phases is fairly starkly illustrated in the table below. The rate of top-line revenue growth slowed from its early rapid pace, an average compounded growth rate of 16% over the 15-year period from 1880 to 1895. In the second phase, growth remained brisk at 14%, but profit margins fell from over 40% to 30%. The return on assets declined consistently. The gap between operating and net income margin increased, as first debt to fund expansion and later federal taxes took an increasing chunk of net income. The high returns earned during phase one undoubtedly drew in new competitors and incentivised them to challenge the Bell patents. For early investors in the American Bell Telephone Company, the rewards were exceptional and were reflected in a rising share price and a dividend payout policy which on average distributed two thirds of the company’s net income in annual dividends. The new competitive environment that followed saw a stabilisation of margins and a reduction of balance sheet pressure as predatory expansion reduced and the company established a working relationship with the authorities. Long-term investors were rewarded by share price gains and a dividend stream which produced a fivefold increase in total returns during the first 20 years of the company and a further doubling in the 20 years that followed.</span> </p>
