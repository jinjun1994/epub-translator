<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The vision of timeshare computing which ultimately led to the development of the Internet had been driven in part by the economics of computing. The high cost of a mainframe for most users makes access to processing facilities economic only through shared use. The first solution to this was access through timeshare facilities. The development of the computer industry quickly made this conclusion questionable, as the emergence of minicomputers and the microprocessor made access to processing power readily available to larger groups of users. Timeshare, though, was only one reason for linking up mainframe computers. Just as military needs during the World War II had accelerated the development of the mainframe, so the perceived threats of the Cold War channelled funds into the development of networking.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">In retrospect, the psychological impact of the successful launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 probably far exceeded the real state of Russian scientific capability. At the time, though, the impact was immediate, and the US government reacted quickly to the perceived threat with the creation of a body charged specifically with the task of ensuring American scientific superiority. The body was titled the Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA for short. Although its initial focus was on space research, within a few years these objectives had been transferred to NASA and ARPA’s main focus became defence. Its funding was to play a vital role in the development of networking technology.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">For ARPA, two main technology objectives were quickly established. First, computers had to talk to each other so as to share information. Second, the links between computers had to be robust so that cutting one link would not disable the entire system. In 1962, ARPA created a new department, the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), charged with researching the issues of network command and control. Joseph Licklider, a behavioural psychologist from MIT, was appointed its first director. This was to prove a significant appointment as Licklider had been heavily involved with research to improve the functionality of computers, including the publication of a seminal work, ‘Man-Computer Symbiosis’, in 1960. He foresaw the development of graphical user interfaces to make computers easier to use and also the need for tools other than the keyboard to make navigation and other tasks easier – in effect, what is now the ‘mouse’. Licklider gradually moved the emphasis of IPTO away from command-and-control technology towards graphics, common languages, recognition conventions and timesharing. Although Licklider was director of IPTO for a relatively short period, his ideas continued to influence the future direction of programs funded under his successors at ARPA. Early in his tenure, Licklider had written a memo to ‘Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network’ that discussed the linking of multiple timeshare computer sites, and the need for common conventions if this was to be achieved. In 1963, the first practical expression was given to this when UCLA and UC Berkeley were commissioned to conduct research on network creation.</span> </p>
