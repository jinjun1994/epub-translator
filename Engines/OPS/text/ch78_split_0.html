<p><span class="style0">The period before World War I saw a marked shift in the structure of the domestic US market. By the early 1900s, Standard Oil had lost its virtual monopoly of global oil. In Asia and Europe it had to contend with Shell and Royal Dutch, and in its own backyard new competitors had sprung up with the discoveries outside Pennsylvania. Although Standard Oil had purchased as many of its emerging competitors as it could, its inability to control global transportation as it had done in Pennsylvania meant there were now other substantial producers and refiners in America. Even so, Standard Oil still controlled nearly two thirds of US refining – not the overwhelming 90% it once had, and perhaps not enough to unilaterally set prices, but a dominant position nonetheless. This was certainly the impression of the public at large. Part of the reason was repeated public attacks from critics of the company, but the main reason was the movement of the company to centre stage in the political arena.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Standard Oil was one of the first truly giant industrial concerns to be put together. For centuries, financial concerns such as Baring Brothers and Rothschilds had operations whose influence spanned the globe. Now the balance of power had begun to shift to the US and new financial dynasties such as the House of Morgan rivaled their older European counterparts. The industrial sector, though, had only recently begun to spawn corporations of similar magnitude. Standard Oil was one of the first, and one of the most important. Its structure, effectively a holding company with operating subsidiaries, was a model subsequently adopted by most major corporations. At the time in America, such a structure ran foul of the state-based legislative framework and it came repeatedly under attack as a consequence. There were also serious questions about the methods it used to persuade competitors to join the trust. Equally there were questions regarding abuse of its monopoly position. The analysis of Standard Oil below gives some idea of the profit benefits conferred by the size of its operation.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Samuel McClure, the proprietor of</span> <span class="style1">McClure’s Magazine</span><span class="style0">, one of America’s leading periodicals, decided to capture the mood of the time by running a feature on trusts. His managing editor, Ida Tarbell, decided to focus on Standard Oil, the original and most powerful trust. Tarbell had a personal axe to grind; she was the daughter of an oil tanker builder from Oil Creek. What distinguished this attack was Tarbell’s personal experience of Standard Oil, her access to a forthright senior executive at the company, and the large circulation of</span> <span class="style1">McClure’s Magazine</span><span class="style0">. In 1902 the monthly publication of the 24-piece series began, culminating in a compilation book in 1904 entitled</span> <span class="style1">The History of Standard Oil</span><span class="style0">. The criticisms made a big impact, and despite having received contributions from Standard Oil during the Presidential campaign of 1904, the newly-elected administration of Theodore Roosevelt eventually pursued the company under the Sherman Antitrust Act.</span> </p>
