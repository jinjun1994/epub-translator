<title>Western Union and the US market - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the US, it was private capital that financed the development of telegraph networks. At first this was a direct result of the growth in the railroads, rather than any great faith in the intrinsic merits of the emerging technology. As in Britain, the telegraph was an important tool in the control and management of the expanding rail networks. It was not long before the potential for users to communicate across a vast new country spurred new levels of interest. Competition for market share ensured rapid growth. By the 1850s, a basic telegraphic grid covered the northeast and midwest states. The early years were marked by heavy capital expenditure, fights over patent access and price wars. The financial pressures these produced brought about a ‘pooling’ arrangement, designed to exclude new competition, and a price-setting and volume-allocation cartel involving the six largest telegraph companies. The arrangement, colloquially known as the ‘Treaty of the Six Nations’, covered most of America and set out spheres of influence, terms for mutual assistance and measures to remove new competition.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The pool proved to be inherently unstable and ungovernable. The pricing war quickly reasserted itself. The war was only resolved when the three largest companies, led by the New York and Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company, merged to become Western Union. Western Union’s emergence as the dominant telegraph company was greatly assisted by the impact of the Civil War. Before the Civil War, the telegraph was still a technology in its infancy. In the 1850s, sending long distance messages by telegraph was expensive and laborious. The electrical signals carried down the telegraph wires grew weaker with distance, requiring a series of relay posts where messages would be recorded by the operator and then re-keyed. From initial transmission to hand delivery of a telegram, it could take a full day for a message to cross the US continent. The main customers tended to be government, businesses and wealthy individuals.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">However, in times of war, speed of communication takes precedence over cost. Just as the Rothschilds amassed a fortune during the Napoleonic Wars in Europe with their efficient information networks and use of carrier pigeons, so the American Civil War enabled financiers such as J. P. Morgan to make large sums from trading government bonds, thanks to timely information on the war’s progress received via the telegraph.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Civil War also stimulated the telegraph business directly. Speed of information was vital to the armed forces, which assumed control of maintaining and extending the telegraph network. Western Union was to inherit more than 14,000 miles of new lines built and paid for by the government. Officially this was simply a return of private property to its owners, but it may have been no coincidence that almost all the wires and poles were returned to Western Union or companies that it absorbed. General Thomas Eckert, the chief of US military telegraphs under Lincoln and later the assistant secretary of war, subsequently took a top management job at Western Union.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The telegraph companies were already in receipt of large government subsidies by the time the Civil War broke out. The Pacific Telegraph Act of 1860 provided for up to $40,000 ($5m) per annum in subsidies to telegraph companies in return for transmission of federal messages. Just as with the railroads, most of these subsidies ended up in the pockets of the proprietors.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The combined impact of merger, government subsidies and the Civil War, ensured that Western Union emerged with a dominant, near-monopoly, position. The importance of information transfer and its close relationship to the railroad was obvious to at least one of the railway tycoons; as Vanderbilt switched his interests into the railroads, he made it his purpose to gain control of the company. The symbiotic relationship with the railroads was vital to the success of the telegraph. For a railroad, the tie with a telegraph company provided it with an unlimited free telegraph service through the lines along their track, and reduced prices along other lines. In return for this service, the railroad typically provided transportation and materials for construction, ongoing maintenance and staffed offices in train stations and depots.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The railroads needed a fast and reliable communication service; Western Union provided this, effectively annexing large parts of the country’s infrastructure as it tied up most of the railroads. Its dominant position made it increasingly difficult for other competitors to encroach, allowing Western Union to grow so large that it became the only real viable partner for railroads. There were more than 100 telegraph companies in the late 1870s, but the vast majority were small ancillaries of railroads. In contrast, by 1878 Western Union had over 7,500 offices, 12,000 employees and nearly 200,000 miles of cable.</span> </p>
