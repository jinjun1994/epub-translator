<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In many ways, the industry was still in its infancy and remained relatively unstable. While Standard Oil was under threat in its homeland, its new overseas competitors were struggling – not only against the North American giant, but also against each other. Shell had an agreement with the Rothchilds to access crude oil supply from the Russian Empire, and this was then refined and shipped to Asia. Initially its principal competitor had been Standard Oil, but increasingly Royal Dutch had eaten into its Asian market and profitability. Shell was desperate for alternative sources of oil to Baku to strengthen its hand in the contract renegotiations with the Rothschilds due in 1900. It had experienced some success with oil strikes in Borneo. However, these proved to be of relatively little commercial value at the time as the crude had low kerosene yields. Its real potential was as a source of transportation fuels for the changing oil-powered engines.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Royal Dutch was also worried because its oilfields in Sumatra appeared to be running dry. The desperate nature of its position can be gauged in the 110 successive dry holes it drilled in the Sumatra area. Eventually it found the new supplies which would underwrite its future. Its immediate problem lay in the competition with Shell and Standard Oil. All three protagonists recognised the impact that competition was having on their profitability. Various discussions took place between Standard Oil and Royal Dutch regarding a possible corporate solution. Samuel Marcus of Shell even travelled to New York to discuss an alliance with Standard Oil. Eventually, in late 1901, Standard Oil offered to take over Shell at a price of $40m ($2.7bn). However, Marcus’s pride and nationalistic bent prevented him from accepting the offer. To have done so would have ended his control of the company and passed it into the hands of an American competitor. Instead he negotiated with Henri Deterding of Royal Dutch, and the result was an organisation managed by Deterding, but which was to be an equal partnership between the two companies, including the Rothschilds as partners. The new entity was to be named British Dutch.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">However, shortly after the arrangement was reached, the conditions for Shell worsened severely. Spindletop in Texas was on the decline. In addition, Shell had had high hopes of recruiting Britain’s Royal Navy as a substantial customer, as the trend seemed to be moving towards using oil-powered engines for ships. However, these hopes were dashed when the Navy elected to continue with coal as its propulsion fuel. As if this was not enough, Royal Dutch’s oil finds in Borneo negated Shell’s supply advantages in Asia. This change in the balance of power removed the joint marketing arrangement as a sustainable option and led, in 1907, to the creation of Royal Dutch/Shell, with Royal Dutch as the 60% majority partner. Difficult as it must have been for Samuel to stomach the merger, it nevertheless proved a fortunate decision for both Marcus and the Rothschilds.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Although Baku had grown to represent almost a third of the world’s supply of crude oil, the oilfields lay at the centre of political strife in the Russian Empire. There were repeated strikes in 1901 and 1902, many organised by a local Georgian named Joseph Djugashvili, later to change his surname to Stalin. After Russia’s humiliation in the 1904 Russo-Japanese War, the strife in Baku intensified, with ethnic conflicts between the Tartars and Armenians to the fore – and, behind this, a growing Bolshevik underground. Anticipating the political problems, the Rothschilds managed to negotiate the sale of their Russian kerosene and oil assets to Royal Dutch/Shell in return for stock in the company. That deal was completed in 1911. The deal left the Rothschilds with a much greater spread of risk and as the largest shareholder in both the Royal Dutch and Shell components of the company. From a Royal Dutch/Shell viewpoint, the deal did not prove a happy one; strife in Baku oilfields continued and spread, eventually culminating in the Communist Revolution of 1917.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Royal Dutch/Shell was soon joined by another non-US competitor. This competitor’s genesis lay in the armaments race that was developing between the great European powers. In an effort to wrench supremacy from Imperial Britain, Germany had recognised that it was vital to build a naval fleet to rival that of its arch competitor. The ensuing armaments race accelerated the rate of technological innovation, spawning among other things the submarine and the torpedo. Eventually the British government reacted by seeking to modernise its fleet. Coal-fired engines were on the way out, to be replaced by the faster and more efficient oil-fired variety. From a strategic perspective, Britain required a secure source of oil supply under its own control and protection. The foreign control of Royal Dutch/Shell meant it was unsuitable, and this effectively left only a Burmah-sponsored company called Anglo-Persian as an option. The relationship between Anglo-Persian and the Scottish-owned Burmah had never been a particularly easy one and the finances of Anglo-Persian had become stretched before Winston Churchill, as First Lord of the Admiralty, proposed an investment by the government of over £2m to take a majority stake in the company. Parliament was swayed, not just by Churchill’s rhetoric on the need for a secure oil supply, but also by the fear that not doing so would place Royal Dutch/Shell in a near monopoly position and replicate the pricing issues raised by Standard Oil.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The fear of monopoly, or trusts as they were known at the time, and their impact on pricing thus became an important influence on the chain of events. In May 1914, the British government took a controlling stake in Anglo-Persian. During World War I, the British Government also took over a German/British distributor of Romanian oil named British Petroleum. In 1916, this was merged with Anglo-Persian, the combined entity taking the name British Petroleum. At a time of military conflict, it gave a huge boost to the oil industry, as oil was the fuel of choice, not only for sea transportation but also for land and air. The boost to the industry had geographic implications, though. US companies were free from wartime constraints and were thus able to develop international markets as the war caused disruption to some of the traditional supply relationships, particularly those in the Balkans. In time, the US would create a new structure in its own oil industry, influenced by legislative changes and the implementation of a series of antitrust reforms.</span> </p>
