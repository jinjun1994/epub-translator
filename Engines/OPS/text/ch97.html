<title>The industry in Europe - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<h1 id="anchor_2739_0"><span class="style1">The industry in Europe</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The automobile began life in Europe but was transplanted to America, which swiftly assumed dominance. Why did this happen? It was nothing to do with technology; through much of the early years – and possibly up until 1910 – the clear technological lead existed in Europe.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The experience in Britain was very similar to that of America in that the background of the early pioneers was in related industries. The established oil engine firm of Crossley Brothers began producing vehicles and spawned an automobile company bearing the same name. The Dennis, Humber and Rover companies all emerged from the cycle industry, and the sheep-shearing industry can lay claim to the antecedents of both the Wolseley (built by Herbert Austin) and the Lagonda (the product of the American engineer Wilbur Gunn). Rolls-Royce was the product of the talents of an electrical crane engineer and an aristocratic racing driver. The British Daimler company emerged from a friendship between an English engineer, F. R. Simms, and Gottlieb Daimler, and this allowed Simms to obtain the British rights to the Daimler name and patents.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Eventually the Daimler Motor Company in Britain emerged from this, but not before it was embroiled in the scheme to control the British automobile industry put together by the financier H. J. Lawson. Lawson had made his fortune in the bicycle industry but had the vision to foresee the future of the automobile industry. In 1895 he formed the British Motor Syndicate with a share capital of £150,000 ($55m), with which he first purchased the British Daimler rights and then proceeded to do the same with all other available patents. The Syndicate’s main business was the leasing of patents and in some ways it can be seen as a precursor of the Electric Vehicle Company. The difficulties the company faced stemmed from the £100,000 purchase of patents from Edward J. Pennington of Chicago, a gentleman who had made many claims of engineering advances but never actually demonstrated one of his vehicles. The British Motor Syndicate went into liquidation in 1901 following a lawsuit loss which undermined its licensing model. It was finally bought out in 1907 for a total sum of £1,000 (under $300,000).</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Syndicate was not Lawson’s only venture to lose money for investors. In 1896 he floated the Great Horseless Carriage Company with a capital of £1m (over $370m). This company sought to design and produce automobiles but lacked the necessary engineering skills to do so and gradually dissipated the capital. Finally, in 1899, there was the Anglo-American Rapid Vehicle Company, which Lawson formed with Pennington. This company was to hold all their respective patents and was capitalised at $75m ($5.4bn). It too fell by the wayside, to the great chagrin of the previously excited investors. Perhaps the investors should not have been quite so surprised, given the involvement not only of Lawson and Pennington, but also a number of the principal figures involved in the Lead Cab Trust affair. Nevertheless, whatever the reputation of the personalities involved, and the repeated warnings of trade journals such as</span> <span class="style1">The Horseless Age</span><span class="style0">, large sums were raised from investors on both sides of the Atlantic.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In Europe the companies of Daimler, Benz and Panhard Levassor continued to prosper, as did the Peugeot operation which had begun its foray into automobiles through its association with Daimler. Just as in America and Britain, a large number of companies emerged, many of them French, reflecting the nexus of power in the industry before the turn of the century. Amédée Bollée operated a foundry and engineering company and had built steam cars in the 1870s before progressing to small production runs of high-quality gasoline cars. A number of other French automobile companies obtained licences to Bollée’s technology and began production. In Paris, Louis Renault adapted a De Dion motorised tricycle into a four-wheel vehicle. Taking patents on his improvements, and as a result of the success of his small vehicle, his little workshop grew into a substantial production facility. There were also pioneers in Italy, including Ettore Bugatti who designed a racing car for the Paris–Madrid race, and two cavalry officers by the name of Agnelli and Gropello whose experiments eventually resulted in the Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino (FIAT).</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It is almost impossible to list all the companies that produced motor vehicles during this time, but over 300 different models of car were advertised in the British magazine</span> <span class="style1">The Autocar</span> <span class="style0">in 1904. The industry was as fragmented in Europe (if not more so) than it was in America. It was in America, though, that the drive for consolidation emerged with the most force.</span> </p>
