<h1 id="anchor_579_0"><span class="style1">Funding the Industrial Revolution</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Industrial Revolution was the driving force for the rapid economic development of Europe and the emergence of America during the 19th century. Goods once created slowly and laboriously by skilled craftsmen could be mass-produced. In a few short years, items once owned only by the very wealthy became available to the masses.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Stage one was the invention of new machinery, driven by steam engines, producing ever larger quantities of goods at ever lower prices. Stage two was the rapid transformation of transport – first in Britain, then in Europe; and then, on a massive scale, in the US. Otherwise, how could these newly mass-produced goods be brought to market quickly and cheaply?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Developing the railways required a huge amount of capital investment, as the canals in Britain had done a generation before. Where would this money come from? Happily, the Industrial Revolution coincided with – and stimulated – the evolution of financial markets. Until that point, the options for investors consisted primarily of purchases of interest-bearing government securities. In an agrarian economy, few ‘growth’ investment opportunities existed. Such high risk/reward ventures as there were consisted mainly of funding or underwriting foreign trade ventures.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Industrial Revolution brought a stream of new industries which required capital, and held out the prospect of huge increases in productivity. The individuals funding these new companies demanded a slice of the profits in return for the risks they were assuming. Increasingly, they were unwilling to accept simple interest-bearing securities with fixed semi-annual or annual payments. Naturally, as profits multiplied, equity funding grew in popularity. New companies were quick to take advantage, and established finance houses – which had grown through their relationship with government and their ability to place government debt – soon adapted to the new world. They, too, began to participate with great gusto in the funding of industrial companies. The famous finance houses of the Rothschilds and Baring Brothers were joined by financiers such as J. P. Morgan, who emerged from their association with the ‘new’ companies and industries.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This period also saw the emergence of a new breed of what we would now call ‘corporate raiders’, attracted by the ready profits to be made. In legal terms, the development of the joint stock company was a critical step: until that point, parliamentary approval was required for the constitution of a new company. Pure equity financing did not become widespread until the late 19th century. But even 200 years ago the investor who so chose could invest outside the UK. The financial press at the time devoted a large proportion of its column inches to international bond issues. The Napoleonic Wars had meanwhile left a heavy legacy of war debt to be financed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the mid-1820s, transport was the dominant class of investable securities. Canals, docks, bridges and roads made up more than half the quoted stock market universe in 1825. Of the rest, the most important sectors were gas and water utilities and mining companies. The latter showed that strong speculative demand was already present in the market. The relatively strong economic conditions created an ideal environment for raising capital for ventures that would otherwise have been deemed highly speculative. The mines were mainly in South America. The promoters argued that by bringing in British technical and management expertise, their fortunes could be resuscitated. Their argument was that previous failures had been the result of local political issues rather than commercial or technical failings.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In reality, the mining did not live up to expectations. Further capital was soon required from shareholders. The excitement that had driven up mining share prices evaporated just as quickly. As figure 1.1 shows, the index of mining share prices rose by almost 600% in less than 12 months, only to fall back just as rapidly. This rapid puncturing of a share price bubble is typical of what happens during a phase in which market valuations are driven more by themes and concept stocks than by profits, dividends and other fundamental considerations. It has been repeated many times since.</span> </p>
