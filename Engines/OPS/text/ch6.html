<h1 id="anchor_447_0"><span class="style1">Purpose of the research</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This book had its origins as an in-depth study of the impact that the great technological inventions of the past 200 years, from the railways to the Internet, have had on financial markets and investors’ fortunes. The research was begun in 1999, just as the great stock market bubble of 1999–2000 was coming to a head, and it seemed that any company connected with the Internet could do no wrong.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The original aim of the research was to satisfy my curiosity, as a professional investor, as to how and why new technologies can create such apparently irrational stock market bubbles. With hindsight we can see quite clearly now how the so-called TMT (technology-media-telecoms) bubble of 1999–2000 developed into the greatest of all stock market manias, just as many of us expected at the time. However, back then, living through it, it simply defied all notions of common sense or professional expertise.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As Director of Global Equity Research at Templeton Investment Management at the time, it was my job to lead the analysis of stocks for a leading international fund management house. I lost count of how many times well-paid analysts from Wall Street sought to promote this or that dot-com company – with no sales and no prospects of earnings in the foreseeable future – with a view to influencing our staff and ultimately our portfolios. The underlying message was that whether we liked it or not these stocks were something we should be adding to our list of stock buys. For this edition of the book, nearly 20 years on, it is somehow fitting that I find myself back working at Templeton. The fundamental truths of investment remain unchanged, as does the need for investment discipline and rigour.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Back in 1999 the problem was that I kept hearing: “This is the new economy, stupid. Don’t you know that things are different in the new economy?” As I scratched my head, trying to make sense of it all, this would often be followed up with the irritating phrase: “You just don’t get it, do you?” In other words: ‘It’s different this time.’ Well, I thought I did get it. My instinct was that the bubble was just that – an outbreak of collective insanity that was one day going to burst. There was no way that many of the companies being sold to investors could ever hope to make a profit, let alone justify the kind of market valuations that were placed on them at the time.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">True, I was not alone in this. Many investors held a similar view. Few of them, however, were fortunate enough to work in organisations which held to their discipline during a time when the pressure to invest and maintain short-term performance was intense. In this regard I was very fortunate – I worked in an organisation where the owners were themselves long-term investors, and as such were willing to support a position if it could be logically justified. Many professional investors were not in this position and found themselves exiting the industry, ironically just when the bubble was about to burst.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">One reason for that is that the incentives to participate in an emerging technology craze are so very powerful. Even in the most austere professional environment, any personal doubts about the sustainability of a high-profile momentum phenomenon tend to be swamped by the institutional imperative of grabbing a piece of the rich short-term pickings on offer. The investment business is dominated by corporations and partnerships whose internal processes are wired to echo St Augustine’s famous plea: “Lord, make me chaste – but not yet.”</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">At the time, with the pressure to jump on the bandwagon so intense, I had to admit that I did not know all there was to know about the new technology. The nagging doubts that I might just be missing something remained. It set me wondering: what happened in the past when new technologies with similar transforming potential had arrived on the scene? How did investors and the media react at the time? Who ended up as winners and losers from those episodes? Maybe there were lessons to be learnt that could explain what was happening with the phenomenon I was living through.</span> </p>
