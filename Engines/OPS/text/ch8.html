<h1 id="anchor_488_0"><span class="style1">The scope of the research</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The ten historical episodes covered in detail in the research were:</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">the railway boom in Britain, from the 1840s onwards</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">the early railroad industry in the United States</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">the development of the automobile industry</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">the story of the discovery of electric light and its commercial exploitation</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">the discovery and early development of crude oil</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">the emergence of the telegraph business</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">the early history of wireless, radio and TV</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">IBM and the growth of the computer industry</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">the PC battles of the 1980s</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">the Internet and the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and beyond.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:3.75px;"></div>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Most of these episodes tended to be associated with just one or two successful companies – Western Union in the telegraph business, GE in lighting, Ford and GM in the automobile industry, IBM in computers, Microsoft in the software business. Yet the eventual success of these companies was far from a foregone conclusion. For every company that built an enduring market position, there were hundreds of others who tried to do the same thing – and failed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In many cases, reconstructing the economic and share price performance of the leading companies involved proved a full-time piece of research in itself. Simply finding and collecting the information was a task which absorbed a huge amount of time. I hope that readers find the graphs that show the earnings growth, return on capital and share price performance of some of the great technological pioneers of the past instructive. I tried to keep the analysis simple and such that comparisons could be made between different time periods and different industries. I did not spend a huge amount of time going into detailed valuation work, partly because of the space it would have absorbed, but mostly because the simple graphs were sufficient to tell the story on their own.</span> </p>
