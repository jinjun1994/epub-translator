<title>IBM lumbers in - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<h1 id="anchor_3891_0"><span class="style1">IBM lumbers in</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In 1980, IBM decided to enter the personal computer market. Moreover, recognising the dynamic nature of the business, it had decided on taking what (for it) was a radical step. IBM sought to avoid the normal bureaucratic channels endemic within its organisation, instead effectively behaving as if it were itself a new entrant – albeit a new entrant with the deepest pockets in the world. IBM was willing to outsource both components and software in an effort to bring to the market a product that would genuinely compete with the Apple.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This step – by one of the world’s most powerful companies – had a number of implications. Firstly, it legitimised the personal computer market, providing reassurance that it was here to stay. Secondly, it ensured that subcontractors would share in the success of the IBM product. Thirdly, it threatened to set an industry standard with potential benefits to anyone who could quickly produce compatible products. Finally, though this was not foreseen at the time, IBM set the trend towards ‘cloning’ in personal computing. The company was putting its brand name on product assembled from components produced by others. This legitimised these components, effectively leading to the whole ‘cloning’ paradigm.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">Apple Computer</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Many histories of Apple have been written, mostly lamenting management inadequacy and missed opportunities. These histories have largely been written by insiders and make fascinating reading on the internal decision-making and politics of the company. Aside from discussion of the colourful personalities involved, two recurrent themes are the technological arrogance of the company and its inability to grasp the strategic shift in direction occurring in the personal computer market. Apple felt it had little to learn from its competitors in a technological sense, the so-called ‘invented here’ syndrome. Its desire to protect its margins in the upper end of the market and consequent refusal to release its technological secrets to others meant it missed the opportunity to become the industry standard.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Whether these accounts have been compiled only with the benefit of hindsight, or whether such failings were understood at the time, is open to question. The share price of the company does not suggest that investors understood or reacted to the problems being stored up. But while it might not have been possible for investors to appreciate what was happening at the time, it was not long before telltale signs emerged.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The decline in profitability in the mid-1980s associated with the Lisa and the slow start of the Apple Mac can be seen from the steady decline in return on equity. Equally, the subsequent success of the new line is reflected in the pick-up in numbers from then until the 1990s. From 1990 onwards, the financial figures increasingly reflected the strategic errors which had occurred earlier. Not only did return on assets fall, but debt levels began to rise, reflecting deteriorating cash flow. For investors, this should have been the signal to sell.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The deterioration continued year on year through the 1990s, with margins declining until eventually the company fell into loss. The share price reaction did not occur until after the debt had begun to build in earnest, and paradoxically when the losses were actually recorded, this marked the bottom in the share price, as Apple’s fortunes recovered and the tech boom began in earnest. Yet the recovery in fortunes was only relative. Returns did not go back to the levels of the 1980s, nor was the debt position meaningfully reduced.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">So far as Mitch Kapor was concerned, the imminent arrival of the IBM personal computer represented an opportunity for him to invade the spreadsheet market. He needed to ensure his product was at a stage where it could be quickly adapted to run on IBM machines; hence the product was redefined to work on the IBM PC. Initially his product was intended to combine spreadsheet, graphics and word processor, but the last of these required resources beyond what Kapor’s new company, Lotus, could provide. Instead of a word processor a database was incorporated and the new product was named Lotus 1-2-3 to reflect its three capabilities.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Kapor initially sought to follow the same route as he had with VisiTrend/Plot but found that Personal Software, then one of the world’s largest software companies on the back of VisiCalc, had no interest in purchasing his competing product. However, Ben Rosen – who, while at Merrill Lynch, had immediately spotted the potential of VisiCalc – also saw the market potential for Lotus 1-2-3. Rosen both committed personal funds and raised funds from other investors. In a short time, more than $5m was raised and the nascent software industry witnessed its first large-scale marketing campaign. The campaign and the product were an overwhelming success. When Lotus 1-2-3 began sales in 1983 it immediately became the top-selling piece of software, grossing over $53m in that year. The effect on VisiCalc was predictable, given that it had been supplanted by a new and better product.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<div class="img_container"><img src="../images/image_11.jpg" style="width:236px;height:2px;" alt="image_11.jpg" /></div>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">Lotus Corporation</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The financial returns for Lotus illustrate the pitfalls for investors in a company the success of which is largely based upon a single product. Lotus had usurped the market developed by VisiCalc by producing a superior integrated product. The superiority of the Lotus 1-2-3 product brought rapid revenue growth and growing market share, but in an increasingly competitive marketplace. As a consequence, margins began to fall sharply, meaning that profits growth was much more muted than the advances in topline revenues. Return on assets and equity remained reasonable through most of the 1980s, but by the end of the decade Microsoft was beginning its relentless advance.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The problem for Lotus was that it had created no barrier to entry in its market segment, something that typically only becomes evident when it is too late and the product is superseded, just as had happened to VisiCalc earlier. Users increasingly had other alternatives, and as Microsoft Windows began to evolve into a genuinely usable interface, Lotus found itself with no protection from the gathering attack. The main attack took the form of the Microsoft Office suite of programs which offered integrated spreadsheet and word processing functions in a Windows environment. As a consequence of this attack, margins and returns continued their decline, such that Lotus moved from being one of the world’s foremost software companies to relative decline.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Against a backdrop of declining earnings, the company was eventually acquired by IBM. It was not that Lotus deliberately sat with all its eggs in one basket – quite the contrary. It was simply that the profitable niche which had been exploited with 1–2–3 was difficult to identify and replicate in other areas. Whether this difficulty stemmed from poor strategic direction, or issues of managerial or technical implementation, Lotus proved unable to build sufficient alternative income streams. For IBM, Lotus had some attractions, as information-sharing products such as Lotus Notes could be better exploited under the IBM umbrella. Such exploitation depended upon their continuing viability under a new information-sharing structure that would come with the arrival of the Internet and the World Wide Web.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">For investors, the lessons from the Lotus experience were not new. Software companies require two things to survive as long-term profitable players. They require constant improvements to their product to fight off competition, and they require somehow to place their product in a position where it can either be allied with or replace the industry standard graphical user interface (GUI). When the effective owner of the GUI decides to produce a competitor product, as Microsoft did with Excel, retaining competitiveness becomes well nigh impossible.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Few companies with a foundation based on a single product manage to translate this into a long-term sustainable business. For those that fail, the share price reaction is typically savage, given the growth expectations that normally underpin valuations of companies with a high-growth history. There is often, of course, a safety net, in that larger competitors will purchase software companies whose fortunes have slipped – in the mistaken belief that this can be altered by virtue of new ownership.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">While Lotus Corporation was an indirect beneficiary of IBM’s entry to the PC market, there were two companies that were much more directly affected. The first was Intel. IBM selected the Intel 8088 chip as the microprocessor, thus giving the machine a faster speed than any other on the market, but also underwriting Intel’s future. The second company affected was the one chosen to write the operating system. Initially IBM contacted the leading figure in the field, Gary Kildall, who had developed CP/M. Kildall offered IBM a licensing arrangement for CP/M, as an alternative to IBM’s offer of $250,000 for outright purchase.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">9.10 – The entrenched against the newcomer: operating system CP/M versus MS-DOS</span> </p>
<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style1">Financial Times</span><span class="style0">, 5 November 1982.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">IBM considered the proposition, but eventually awarded the contract for development of an operating system to Bill Gates of Microsoft. Gates had argued that, as the new Intel processor was more powerful than its predecessor, the capabilities of CP/M would have to be enhanced anyway, meaning that there was no reason why an alternative could not be considered. Gates’s view eventually held sway and the contract was awarded to Microsoft in November 1980. Microsoft was placed under intense time pressure. IBM was intent on bringing the product to market within the shortest possible time frame, and Microsoft had less than six months to produce the desired result. Microsoft’s solution was to adapt an existing operating system, one produced for the 8086 chip by Seattle Computing Products and named SCP-DOS. Eventually, under the most intense pressure, Microsoft produced the adapted operating system known as MS-DOS.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There were two other critical elements. Firstly, IBM was persuaded to outsource vital parts of the PC, effectively ceding control over the key elements of its product. This was the first step towards open architecture, though IBM did not realise the significance of its actions at the time. The decision was influenced by the fact that software was what sold PCs, and software was more easily developed and had greater commercial prospects when programmers had knowledge of the systems. Second, Gates negotiated the right to sell MS-DOS to third parties. The stage was set for Microsoft’s later dominance in the software business; if IBM became the industry standard, Microsoft’s operating system would have to be purchased by all competitors. In order to avoid a potential litigation issue with Kildall, who had claimed MS-DOS made use of his work on CP/M, IBM offered a choice of operating system with its PC. However, as it did so with a significant price difference, the only rational choice was MS-DOS.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The relegation of CP/M was not initially obvious. CP/M had the dominant market share at the time and the support of most existing PC users. The key to what followed was that IBM was helping to create an entirely new user community, one which demanded a user-friendly environment, something to which Microsoft was attuned in a way that Kildall’s research-oriented company, Digital Research, was not. The eventual outcome was that MS-DOS gradually pulled away from CP/M as the industry standard. In 1991, Digital Research, now a shadow of its former self, was sold to Novell.</span> </p>
