<h1 id="anchor_3826_0"><span class="style1">From myth to reality – two new products</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Allen and Gates contacted Ed Roberts, who after a demonstration of their BASIC software agreed to purchase it from their company, now renamed Micro-Soft, when it could be shown to work on the Altair. Allen was later offered and accepted the position of director of software at MITS. The quest then began to develop sufficient memory for the Altair to allow it to house the BASIC software, while still leaving enough space for users to make use of the language. To be practical, there had to be a method of storing programs and avoiding the untenable position of having to re-input them every time the computer was switched on. Roberts had already designed a 4k memory board (i.e. 16 times the size of the 256 bytes supplied with the early machines). So far as program storage was concerned, he wanted to move from paper tape to a more advanced method, such as tape cassettes or the more expensive but faster disk drives. Roberts decided that disk drives represented the way forward and initiated a project to that end, enlisting Bill Gates to write the necessary interface software. Both of these developments were to be vital in the eventual success of the PC, but neither of these early initiatives was successfully completed. The memory board never worked properly and was prone to failure. Gates had insufficient time to spend on the disk-drive software project, given his other commitments, which included a series of roadshows to publicise Altair.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">These flaws were to prove fatal to MITS’s hopes of dominating the new market. Combined with its inability to service existing demand, the marketplace was wide open for competitors. Aside from the advantage of bringing the product to market first and being a trailblazer in this regard, all Altair really had was price – and this depended upon its deal with Intel. Moreover, to maintain this price, margins had to be kept razor thin, meaning that MITS depended upon volume sales of Altair and higher-margin peripherals for its profitability. Worse still, the rapid expansion had left the company unable to develop the potential of the peripherals business. It was not long, therefore, before the gaps were exploited. For example, a company called Processor Technology was formed to manufacture superior 4k memory boards. MITS tried to exclude them from the market by bundling the BASIC software with its unreliable memory board, and trying to make it uneconomic to purchase the software alone. The natural consequence was that users simply bought the memory boards which worked and pirated the software. MITS was not ignorant of the dangers posed to its market lead by the flaws in its equipment and the unavailability of higher value add-ons. The company continued to work on these areas, even if at times it appeared in denial about the self-evident shortcomings.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The company’s strategy contained both positive and negative elements. On the negative side, it sought to disparage both competitors and their products. It also sought exclusive contracts with distributors to stock only MITS products (in addition to its own product-bundling strategy). On the positive side MITS sought to rectify some of the existing quality issues while increasing the pressure on Bill Gates to complete the disk software.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">One further strand was added. In response to the development of the Motorola MC6800 processor and the potential it might provide for competitors MITS decided to build another machine – but one based around the Motorola chip. The machine was named the Altair 680b and retailed for just under $300. The machine was launched at roughly the same time as an equivalent produced by a new competitor, Southwest Technical Products. At first sight the Altair 680b could have been viewed as a sensible move to protect MITS leadership position by offering a competitive product which would potentially deter new entrants. The problem was that the 680b could not run the software developed for the Intel processor – so not only were the production tasks doubled, so too were the programming ones. And they doubled at a time when the staff could barely cope with the existing fixes and development requirements. Gates did complete the code for the disk drive in early 1976, but in the intervening period had been spending an increasing amount of his time broadening the appeal of his BASIC by adapting it for other computers.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">MITS’s early advantage was compromised by its inability to deliver the product and support, which in turn was undermined by the distraction of the attempt to produce a non-compatible alternative. The MITS products held no great technological lead given that they were based on third-party processors. The essential advantage rested on the kudos flowing from its groundbreaking product and the price at which it sold it. The technological lead was quickly whittled away by others who had been working along similar lines but were spurred to redouble their efforts by the obvious success of the Altair. The new competitors comprised a mixture of ‘amateur’ enthusiasts, and more overtly commercially oriented ventures. In this there were many similarities to the automobile industry at the beginning of the 20th century. Back then, there were hundreds of very small companies who would buy in the major components and seek to use their skills to assemble a working car. They would survive on credit provided by their suppliers, but were often able to be pre-paid in the early days of the industry, when demand was well in excess of supply and purchasers were willing to conduct their own maintenance.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The main difference was that the automobile was a low-volume item and the personal computer was high-volume. The PC industry was to grow and mature much more quickly than the auto industry, but it did so along very similar lines. The keys to success proved identical. Firstly, there was the simple issue of the product – was it reliable and priced correctly? Secondly, would it do what you wanted and was it interchangeable? In other words, could an individual proficient on one PC be equally so on another? Thirdly, was it all-purpose? Was there distribution and after-sales support?</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The speed with which the industry matured left little scope for error. The real competitive threat came from organisations like IMSAI, formed by the former IBM salesman Bill Millard shortly after the launch of the Altair. Millard was convinced that there existed a large latent market for computers in small business applications. Millard believed that if computers could do simple accounting-type functions, the sales potential was enormous. The initial condition of MITS, though, was such that it could not have supplied assembled machines to Millard’s specifications even if it had had the desire to do so.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Millard was forced to produce an alternative. This was done by pulling apart the Altair and reconstructing it. Despite correctly identifying the target market, IMSAI ran into many of the problems which hindered MITS. Fuelled by a growing market and an aggressive sales force, IMSAI quickly established a strong market position. The IMSAI machine purchased the CP/M disk operating system developed by Gary Kildall for $25,000, and BASIC software to run on it. It was arguable whether the IMSAI machine was any better than Altair, and the instructions and maintenance associated with it were threadbare. In practice, it was scarcely more user-friendly. IMSAI learned from MITS’s distribution errors in requiring exclusivity and out of IMSAI was spawned a franchise distributor named ComputerLand, started by the former sales director Ed Faber. Despite the problems being stored up by the lack of support for the original product and the consequent slowing revenue growth, the sales-dominated culture at the company pushed forward the launch of a new product with an integral screen, the VDP-80. This was supposed to replace some of the revenue from the first machine but the VDP-80 had not been fully tested and no sooner was the product shipped than it was promptly returned under warranty. The whole picture deteriorated and as cash drained out of the company it was forced to seek protection from its creditors. In mid-1979 it filed for Chapter 11.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The demise of IMSAI followed that of MITS. For MITS, though, at least Ed Roberts managed to sell the company as a going concern while it retained a meaningful market position. Perhaps spurred by the entrance of a new company named Apple and a product from Commodore, Roberts sold MITS to Pertec in a stock swap for the equivalent of $6m. In return, Pertec received the Altair machines – which were effectively out-of-date. Much to the disgust of Roberts, the software which was supposed to be part of the deal, was deemed by the courts to be the property of Microsoft and not MITS, but fortunately for Roberts this proved insufficient to undermine Pertec’s intentions. Perhaps Roberts’s unfortunate experience in the calculator industry stood him in good stead – or perhaps Pertec’s management was simply incapable of sustaining the necessary development process as the industry advanced. In any case, this time Roberts grabbed the deal, and within a short space of time MITS was no longer a presence in the personal computer market.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The advent of the personal computer and the development of the microprocessor potentially opened up whole new vistas. The immediate impact, as well as the future uses, of computing were relatively accurately forecast by the leading lights in the industry. The only major errors were those based on the presumption that human nature would change or be changed by the new advances (see figure 9.6).</span> </p>
