<p><span class="style0">Clearly revenues could not come from customer subscriptions since the move to flat-rate payments and unlimited usage had already begun. Revenues needed to be garnered from other sources, which primarily meant advertising. In the early years AOL had eschewed advertising. Indeed one of its pitches had involved pointing out the absence of advertising on its service. The business model soon changed, however, and advertising revenue became key. Since the medium was a new one, revenues did not immediately flood in. However, AOL proved to have established a sufficient brand presence and subscriber base in its own right that it was not long before retailers such as Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble had signed up.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Moreover, content providers also found the rules had changed under the new regime. Although AOL managed to make the transition, it was not a smooth one. The move to flat-rate payments and unlimited access caused an overload on AOL’s systems of such proportions that the backlash against the quality of the service threatened the existence of the company. AOL was forced into a policy of reimbursement and compensation to head off legal moves and had to suffer the indignity of seeing its competitors produce advertising that pointed out AOL’s lack of service. Nevertheless the systems were eventually upgraded and with the new revenue model AOL resumed its inroads into the market share of its major competitors, to the point where, in a complex deal involving WorldCom and Bertelsmann, AOL obtained control of CompuServe. Thus, by October 1997, AOL had completed a remarkable transformation from pariah to victor. The continued evolution of AOL was not yet complete. Even as the ink was drying on the CompuServe deal a new plan was being made, this time for the acquisition of the now declining Netscape. Just over a year later a strategic alliance was announced with Sun Microsystems which involved the absorption into AOL of Netscape.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Perhaps more than any other company, AOL can be said to have pioneered the growth in the Internet. At no time did it benefit from patent protection or licence agreements. It had to rely on its ability to react to circumstances and to take risks where this was needed. As such, it was forced to fight its way out of tough spots on many occasions. Fortunately the stock market environment in which it operated was a massive assistance. Although the market did react to negative developments, the valuation it was prepared to bestow at other times gave AOL enormous freedom to manoeuvre, culminating in its infamous merger with Time Warner in October 2000. When it was announced, this was the first major takeover of an ‘old’ economy company by one from the ‘new’ economy – put another way, of one with profits by one without. AOL used the strength of its share price and hence its market capitalisation to capture assets that would have otherwise been well out if its reach.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The story did not end there. In abstract, the logic of the AOL-Time Warner deal was impeccable. Putting together distribution and content has a long business pedigree and continues to be a key theme in markets. In practice the transaction proved to be a disaster, at least for Time Warner’s shareholders. When, in 2009, the rump of AOL was finally demerged from Time Warner, the latter’s chairman and CEO described the merger as “the biggest mistake in corporate history”. Aside from inflated revenue and shareholder lawsuits, the main challenge for the newly combined entity was that AOL was swiftly becoming out of date. The recession that followed the bursting of the stock market bubble in 2000 hit advertising revenues hard, while the move towards increasingly free distribution of print media began the demise of subscription models for Internet access, and the growth in broadband services created a new environment to which the company had few answers. AOL was left looking like a dinosaur as the telecoms companies provided free access, search companies grabbed advertising, and email was given away for free. In 2002 the company was forced to write down the goodwill associated with the merger by $99bn. After the demerger, AOL’s second incarnation as an independent company lasted just six years, with the one-time market leader acquired by the telecoms company Verizon for $4.4bn in 2015, a mere fraction of the value placed on it when the Time Warner merger was first announced.</span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">AOL</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">AOL’s chequered financial history is readily apparent. In the early days, analysing the accounts required constant to-ing and fro-ing between different years in an effort to separate the operating results from other items such as acquisitions/disposals, financing and changes to accounting treatment. In many ways analysing AOL was the same as trying to analyse the acquisitive conglomerates of the 1970s and 1980s. The business never appeared to be in a ‘steady state’, making it difficult to estimate future operating margins and rates of subscriber growth. Some analysts argued that the changing nature of the business made this analysis fruitless, but such an argument was spurious. For any investor buying something, the more information that can be gained about the ‘substance’ of the something that is being bought the better. Sadly, for Time Warner, this did not appear to be a principle that was followed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The background to the AOL merger was a gross revenue growth rate in excess of 50% but a cost of sales that had grown at least as fast as revenues. The main danger, though, was not the initial margin but the changing nature of the pricing model. The service had migrated from a charge-for-use environment to a flat-rate payment model for unlimited access. In other words, service providers were locked into a commodity offering with fixed revenues and variable cost. AOL attempted to address this by positioning itself as a content provider, but found itself caught between the scissor blades of competing access and content providers.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">From a financial perspective, AOL was one of the few Internet companies that succeeded in bartering its ‘bubble’ valuation into a significant stake in another company that enjoyed the old-fashioned characteristics of revenues and assets. At the time of the merger, Time Warner had revenues of $32bn, four and a half times those of AOL and much higher operating margins. The deal was justified on the back of AOL’s faster growth prospects, but, as history records, those prospects turned out to be illusory. It is fair to observe that it was not just AOL’s share price that was inflated by the TMT bubble. Time Warner also benefited from a TMT-style rating. There were excess valuations on both sides of the deal. AOL succeeded in getting access to Time Warner’s content and branding, but more importantly, in a financial sense, it gained cash flow and profits. The deal was very much in keeping with the vision AOL had consistently espoused and confirmed its reputation for astute and opportunistic management. It was left to the stock market to face the cold reality of lower future earnings. The difference between AOL and some of its contemporaries is that it took the myth and traded it for the best available reality. It behaved logically in using its inflated share price to buy assets and hence reduce the downside risk to its market rating.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The actual outcome proved worse than expected; not only did sustained profitability prove illusory, but the stability of the underlying core business was also slowly undermined by competitive pressures and a series of management missteps. In 2009 Time Warner completed the spinning off of AOL, returning it to the stock market as a separate listed company. After eight years of pedestrian performance during this phase, illustrated in figure 10.14, it was eventually purchased by the telecoms company Verizon for $4.4bn. That purchase price was 98% lower than the peak TMT bubble market capitalisation AOL had commanded at its peak.</span> </p>
