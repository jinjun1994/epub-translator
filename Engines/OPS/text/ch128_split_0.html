<p><span class="style0">The process of building ENIAC, however, had not been an altogether smooth one. Given the egos involved, and the intense time pressure under which the ENIAC project was being run, it is not surprising that personality conflicts soon developed. ENIAC was a great success. The machine was not without design flaws, most notably the fact that it could not store programs. This meant instructions had to be re-input each time a task was set up. Mauchly and Eckert took a pragmatic approach, deciding that solving this flaw should wait for a new project rather than slow down the completion of ENIAC. They also avoided the trap into which Babbage had fallen, recognising that continual delay and cost overruns quickly tire the patience of the funding body.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Support was also forthcoming from another direction. John von Neumann, a brilliant mathematician from the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, had been working for some time on the top-secret Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. Since late 1943, he had been engaged in trying to solve the mathematics of implosion in order to develop a controlled detonation of an atomic bomb. Resolving the problem required the solution of an enormous system of partial differential equations, something that if it was to be conducted by conventional means would require huge resources of time and manpower. When Herman Goldstine of the ENIAC engaged Von Neumann in conversation about the project at the Moore School, he was unaware of the Manhattan Project and Von Neumann was unaware of ENIAC. Given the task in which he was engaged, Von Neumann was enthralled by the specific purposes to which the new machine could be put and the potential for further general applications. He was to become involved in the proposal for a new version of the machine that overcame its initial shortcomings. In the meantime, the pressing needs of the Los Alamos Project led to ENIAC being used to assist with the determination of the feasibility of the atomic bomb trigger. Although it was a cumbersome process, inhibited by the shortcomings of the machine and the need for over one million IBM <span id="anchor_3479_228"></span>cards,<a href="ch135.html#anchor_3644_0">⁸¹</a> ENIAC provided invaluable assistance.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Von Neumann’s involvement was important in a number of regards. As a highly respected figure in the academic community, his seal of approval for ENIAC carried a great deal of weight and helped win over the sceptics. Secondly, in developing a new upgraded version, Mauchly and Eckert were able to draw on Von Neumann’s logical and mathematical prowess. Against that, the collaboration with Von Neumann also introduced further tension to the group. The tension was raised in June 1945 when Von Neumann circulated a paper under his own name on the proposed successor to ENIAC, to be known as the Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Calculator, or EDVAC. Although ENIAC had ultimately cost nearly $500,000 ($7m) to develop, unlike Babbage who a hundred years before had lost the confidence of the Duke of Wellington by attempting to move to a new machine before the old one was even working, the scientists at the Moore School were able to retain the confidence of their sponsoring body, the US Army. As a consequence, in late 1944 a further grant was issued by the army of $105,600 ($1.5m) to build the new EDVAC machine.</span> </p>
