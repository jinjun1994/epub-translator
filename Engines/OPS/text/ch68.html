<h1 id="anchor_1862_0"><span class="style1">Conclusions</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The battle for the supply of lighting was one fought over decades rather than years. The gas companies had been able to negotiate monopoly rights for geographic areas because of the high capital commitment required to set up the necessary distribution infrastructure. Once the costs of this infrastructure had been amortised, these exclusivity rights allowed the companies to become very profitable. Most gas companies acted predictably, maintaining high prices protected by their contractual rights. Such a pricing strategy meant gas lighting was typically restricted to communal areas funded by municipalities or large commercial premises. Only very wealthy households could afford gas lighting, leaving the way open for kerosene to capture the household mass market.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The profits earned by gas companies provided the incentive for the development of electric light. The economics of electric light were similar to gaslight. High initial capital expenditure was required, with meaningful returns on capital only arriving once the infrastructure was fully in place and the market expanded. What electricity therefore required if it was to supplant the gaslight was a technological edge at a competitive price.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Arc lighting failed to provide the technological edge and was consequently unable to displace the existing providers. This is not to say that the threat it provided was not taken seriously – both by the financial sector and the companies themselves. The financial sector reacted by marking down the share prices of the gas companies and raising capital for the new entrants. In both cases it did so in an indiscriminate manner. For investors in the gas companies, at least, there was the possibility of a recovery in the share price, and indeed in the medium term this is what happened when it became clear that arc lighting was not going to be able to sustain a commercial threat.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For investors in the arc lighting companies, the outcome was less palatable. Driven by an increasing level of available liquidity associated with economic recovery and growth, investors had committed sizeable funds to the newly launched companies. Most companies associated with the so-called ‘Brush Bubble’ used up the capital they had raised by building infrastructure, only to find that the product did not satisfy consumer needs and hence was not commercial. As a consequence, most ended up in the hands of liquidators. A few companies, particularly those involved in the creation of electrical generators, were to survive as the equipment they produced proved important for a different form of electric light, the viability of which was ultimately sustained. The main point, though, was that capital was willing to flow to the new ‘hot’ area well before viability had been established. This process was either assisted or stimulated by the support of the financial press and the promoters of the new companies.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Brush companies’ activities represented basic business strategy – a strategy repeated in most industries where infrastructure development was a pre-condition for increasing the number of end users. For example, the radio industry built broadcasting stations to help the sale of radio sets. More recent examples include the efforts by microprocessor manufacturers to encourage new software applications – ones which continually increase demand for higher-margin and higher-specification computer chips. While the commercial reasons for such actions are valid, there are also reasons related to the financial markets. Companies are typically quick to take advantage of periods of optimism and the attendant opportunities to raise capital. That applied in the case of the Brush companies, and it still applies in relation to newer companies. To the extent that investors are willing to invest on the basis of a concept and unproven commercial viability, there will invariably be those who will willingly accommodate the desire for indiscriminate investment.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The irony was that when Edison began to make progress with the incandescent lamp, the press – supported by the scientific community – proved to be substantially more sceptical. Edison knew the importance of propaganda and worked extremely hard to maintain a confident public façade, even when progress lagged expectation. This was vital, since without such a façade it is unlikely that the available financial backers, chastened by the demise of arc lighting, would have provided sufficient capital to bring the technology to a commercial footing. Even with Edison’s track record, there were numerous periods when further capital was nearly not forthcoming.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Eventually, problems with the incandescent lamp were overcome and electric lighting was ready to move to the next stage – supply of the service – an area where Edison was less well suited. His scientific ego made him slow to recognise the reality that part of his system was inferior. This was one factor in the eventual transformation of Edison General Electric into General Electric and his loss of control and influence. However, the main driving force was that the industry was not highly profitable and the providers of capital required sufficient consolidation to take place to put it on a firmer financial footing. When economic conditions tightened and capital availability declined in the early 1890s, the consolidation phase took place. Over successive years thereafter, profitability began to improve, but it was still a long time before returns were earned that would justify the level of capital which had been committed to the incandescent lamp, let alone its arc predecessor.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There are many modern parallels to this. A recent one at the time of the first edition of this book lay in the level of funds committed to mobile telephony, particularly for the purchase of government licences. Any technological advance which requires huge capital expenditure always runs a real risk of disappointing returns in the early years, even if it is ultimately successful. Where companies have overextended themselves to fund such expenditure, then typically during the first period of general economic difficulty they find themselves at the mercy of capital markets. These markets do not show mercy and the rationalisation process which takes place does so at valuations which reflect the balance of power rather than future long-term prospects. The biggest and most successful lighting companies all experienced a change of control when cash flow became an issue. Investors who successfully avoided the arc lighting bubble, sold gas lighting and bought incandescent lighting, even if they managed to make all these correct technological choices, would still have had to be careful about the price at which they made their purchases and the stability of the financial structure of the company in question. In other words, picking the technology was only one part of the equation. It certainly assisted in identifying the losers, the ‘old’ technology companies, but selecting the winners required the patience to wait until the industry had matured sufficiently to evolve into an appropriate operating structure. Effectively this meant waiting for a recession to cause the shake-out.</span> </p>
