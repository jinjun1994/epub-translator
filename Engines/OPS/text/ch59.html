<p><span class="style0">The gas lighting industry had not been idle in the face of the threats posed by electric arc lighting. In 1886, the incandescent gas mantle was developed and patented by Carl Auer von Welsbach. This dramatically upgraded the quality of gas lighting and was to help sustain the competitiveness of the gas lighting industry into the 20th century. For the most part, the sites where arc lights had been tried returned to gas lighting. Arc lighting simply could not provide the correct type of light on a reliable and commercial basis. Companies such as the American Brush Company and its British sister, the Anglo-American Brush Electric Company, gradually disappeared from sight, either going into liquidation or being acquired by their incandescent competitors.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Other early pioneers of arc lighting survived, mainly as a result of discovering that developmental work done to assist with lighting also had alternative applications. Thus gas lighting comfortably saw off the competitive threat of the arc light, underlining how existing participants in an industry always react to an external threat. Threatened companies usually seek to upgrade their existing product and reduce its price. On some occasions, this is sufficient to retain the market. In others, the technological gap remains too large and the incumbent company either goes out of business or embraces the new technology itself. Whatever the result, forecasts of profitability for a new technology often overstate its real economic potential, as they ignore the fact that there will be a competitive response. For new entrants, finances are invariably limited, and the inevitable competitive response produces worse-than-expected cash flow. As a consequence, even when the technology actually does prove to be superior, receivership and bankruptcy are still frequently the result.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">History records that investors lost huge sums of money by investing in the arc lighting companies. The losses were not a result of a misguided view of electrical light as providing a prospective technological breakthrough. Eventually that breakthrough came. The problem was that this branch of the technology could not provide the type of light required for widespread use, nor could it compete commercially, even in smaller specialist segments of the market.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Whether arc lighting might have eventually become viable against gas lighting will never be known, because arc lighting was itself supplanted by a superior electrical lighting technology. The arc lighting companies were aware of these threats. They knew there would be competition to replace gas lighting. They were conscious of the need to see off the threat of incandescent lighting. They were encouraged, however, by the prevailing body of evidence which supported the view that light could not be subdivided – something which, if true, meant that the incandescent lamp was doomed to failure. (Subdivision here refers to the dilution of the intensity of light.)</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Arc lighting established a firm beachhead on the strength of its early successful deployment, and in public the arc lighting companies continued to point to the inroads the technology had made and to reiterate the scientific obstacles to development of alternatives. This was to prove a dangerous strategy, as it encouraged competitor companies to put their energy and resources into the development of subdivided light. They were eventually successful, sealing the fate of those companies who had either spurned this track, or followed it only halfheartedly. The eventual fate of the Brush Company was to be bought by Thomson-Houston, one of its competitors in this new field, which had scrambled to obtain access to incandescent lighting.</span> </p>
