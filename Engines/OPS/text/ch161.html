<p><span class="style0">Early visionaries such as Bush, Engelbart and Nelson had all seen the potential in improved access to stored information. This potential was not simply the timeshare value of allowing many more individuals access to electronic libraries, but also the ability to move away from historical hierarchical referencing methods which until then had been the only practical method of cataloguing large sets of information. The creation of a network of networks had made the physical linking of information repositories a reality, but there remained no referencing system to allow these physical links to be exploited. As a result, the Internet in its early days remained largely the preserve of the users for whom it was originally constructed.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">In the 1970s, before email, the Internet had been the preserve of specialists. Sending and receiving information had required the ability to compile, transmit and decode information. Email greatly simplified the transmission of information and led to a rapid increase in the use of the Internet. Once information could be easily transmitted, what was then needed was the ability for it to be easily stored and accessed. Visionaries such as Ted Nelson sought to create such a system (in Nelson’s case, the long-running effort mentioned earlier, named Xanadu) but by the late 1980s nothing had emerged. This was to change in the 1990s as the practical demands of science, the increasing availability of local computing power and the availability of the Internet combined to produce what is now known as the ‘World Wide Web’.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the early 1980s Tim Berners-Lee was a consulting software engineer at CERN, the European particle-physics laboratory in Geneva. One of the problems he faced in his work was an almost impenetrable jungle of information. Projects at CERN typically involved many different individuals and groups of individuals and were frequently related to other projects either past or contemporaneous. In order to track the interdependencies, Berners-Lee wrote a program named Enquire. A page in Enquire contained information on a particular person/subject/object and represented a node which could only be created by linking it to another node. Each page contained a footnote of references and the relationship to other nodes.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This system was fully constructed, though Berners-Lee left it behind when he departed CERN at the end of his contract period. In September 1984 he returned to CERN having obtained a fellowship specialising in the acquisition and control of data. He began by trying to recreate Enquire, but found that a departure was necessary if his program was to be able to access external information – information that had not necessarily been stored according to a centrally defined hierarchical classification system. Previous attempts at creating generalised storage and retrieval systems had all foundered on this rock. The problem was that in order for any system to work, all users were forced to conform to its rules and hence necessarily change some of their working methods.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The solution had been articulated in theory many times, mainly in the United States, but never achieved. The Internet had not seen the same take-up in Europe as it had in America for various reasons. What Berners-Lee saw was a network which already had a standardised set of protocols for packet switching (IP/TCP) and a system which was inclusive in that it allowed both VAX- and Unix-based users to have access. Berners-Lee submitted at least two proposals to CERN for the creation of a non-hierarchical hypertext-based system. Finally, after seeing his proposal twice put to one side, he embarked on the project on his own. The name he gave to the system under development was the World Wide Web.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">His challenge then was to persuade the scientific community to appreciate the merits of his proposed system. It was hard going. Different groups of users found it difficult to see their areas of specialisation in a wider context and Berners-Lee found himself having to develop the necessary tools himself to demonstrate the power of his proposal. Using a NeXT computer – newly arrived on the market courtesy of Steve Jobs – he was able to exploit its capabilities to create a program for building, browsing and editing hypertext pages. This involved writing a protocol for transferring hypertext; the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). This effectively allowed computers to talk together over the Web using the also-developed addressing system, the universal resource indicator (URI). The next step was the evolution of a language (hypertext markup language, or HTML) which allowed the creation and formatting of pages with hypertext. Accessing information required a browser that would decode the address, the URIs and allow editing facilities on Web pages. This constituted the Web client.</span> </p>
