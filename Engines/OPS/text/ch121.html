<title>Babbage and his engines - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<h1 id="anchor_3327_0"><span class="style1">Babbage and his engines</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Babbage believed a machine that could perform the calculations and print the results, thus removing inevitable human errors from the process, was what was needed. What Babbage proposed was a machine that could do mechanically what had been achieved in France through recourse to a battery of individuals. It was the replacement of laborious and error-prone manual calculation that lay behind Babbage’s idea for the ‘difference engine’. The engine was to mechanically recreate the known properties of numbers, in particular the relationship between numbers multiplied by themselves, or powers. These relationships enabled users of figures to perform complex calculations with a simple checking mechanism. The trick was to construct a machine capable of performing the calculations. To assist in obtaining funding, Babbage constructed a small working prototype that he marketed with the support of the Astronomical Society (which he had helped to found). With the backing of the society, Babbage appealed to the British Treasury for financial support. The appeal was based on a shrewd knowledge of the British government’s reliance on the merchant and Royal navies. Shipping required maps and navigational tables. Their accuracy in turn relied on calculations being correct. The government listened to Babbage’s overtures and the Exchequer awarded him the sum of £1,500 (roughly $1m) to develop a ‘difference engine’.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Interestingly, this was awarded around the same time that proposals to improve the system of communication between the Admiralty and Portsmouth through the use of electric signals (the telegraph) was being turned down by the same government. In a pattern that has proven to be endemic to commercial scientific efforts, Babbage soon found that his initial estimate of the cost of development was too low. What he needed were both designs for the working mechanisms and skilled operators who could produce the equipment to the necessary level of precision.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Babbage’s initial grant of £1,500 towards the total cost of £5,000 ($4m) to build the difference engine was not unqualified. Many eminent members of the scientific community publicly disparaged his efforts. What Babbage required was a publicity campaign to provide reassurance to those providing the capital to support his efforts, which, in this case, was the UK government. He did little to win the support of public or scientific opinion at large.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The adverse comment on his work began to undermine his financial support. Babbage was forced to fall back on his personal inheritance of some £100,000 (nearly $70m). After spending £6,000 of his personal funds, he persuaded the British prime minister, the Duke of Wellington, to advance a further £1,500. This was followed by further lobbying and two additional allocations of £3,000. But even after spending over £30,000 ($20m) of his and the government’s money, Babbage still had not produced a final working version of his machine. Eventually, after disagreements over money, his chief engineer walked out, taking with him some of the equipment and components of the engine.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">What Babbage had in 1833, therefore, was a small working prototype and the expertise he had gained from his efforts over the years. He no longer had government support, nor in many ways did he have the desire to continue the quest to build the engine. The question of whether it could fulfil the tasks he had specified had been resolved by his efforts, and those of a Swedish scientist named Georg Scheutz, who had built a scaled-down version of the difference engine from the reports he had received from England. Once the machine had shown it could do the job, the challenge receded for Babbage. Work on constructing the difference engine effectively ended in 1834. The challenge of physically constructing the difference engine was replaced by that of the theoretical construction of a machine of even greater power, which Babbage named the ‘analytical engine’. Wellington declined the opportunity to provide public finance and Babbage was left to fund the development work on his own, supported by voluntary contributions. One of these came from the unlikely source of Augusta Ada, the young daughter of the poet Lord Byron. Ada proved to be an adept mathematician and was absolutely entranced with the work of Babbage. She was to provide Babbage with emotional and scientific support in his quest to design the analytical engine. When she married William King, the future Earl of Lovelace, her husband also supported Babbage.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Plans were drawn up for the construction of the engine. The engine would have various component parts to perform separate tasks. There was a ‘store’, which would contain the variable upon which operations were to be conducted, and the results of these operations. There would be the ‘mill’, into which the variable would be brought for the operations to be conducted, and finally sets of defined formulae for the computation of known tasks. The design thus predated modern computers by over a hundred years, these three functions equating to what we now know as the memory, central processing unit and algorithms respectively. Babbage also suggested the use of punch cards to control the general operation of the system and the definition of the variables.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The fate of the analytical engine was to mirror that of the difference engine. History has shown that both machines would have worked, but unfortunately neither was ever fully constructed. Both were interesting scientific curios, but failed to attract sufficient funds to be developed. The development of digital computation would not be resurrected for some considerable time after Babbage stopped his work. Why did it not get taken further? Perhaps Babbage’s personal wealth blinded him to the need to maintain the support of his principal backers. Perhaps also the lack of urgency stopped him producing a working prototype that the customer could actually use. Whatever the reason, his inability to maintain confidence in his work left Babbage viewed as a sad and ridiculed figure by some parts of the population, although still a respected if idiosyncratic scientist to others. It was only well after his death that the pioneering nature of his work was widely recognised. His obituary described his engines as examples of ‘noble failure’.</span> </p>
