<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Just as the use of hydrocarbons for lighting can be discerned in records of ancient times, so too can the knowledge which underpins electricity. The discovery of electricity can, for example, be traced back to 600 bc and the observation by Thales, one of the seven sages of Greece, that small bodies of amber attract. Alternatively one can move forward to 1269 to the description by the French crusader Peter the Pilgrim of the magnetic qualities of lodestone (a natural iron oxide). In the 1600s the term ‘electricity’ – derived from the Greek</span> <span class="style1">elektron</span> <span class="style0">(meaning amber) – was used in the first English book of physics to describe the attraction. However, it was another 200 years before the big breakthrough <span id="anchor_1575_121"></span>appeared.<a href="ch68.html#anchor_1883_0">³¹</a> In 1831, Michael Faraday – building on the work of scientists such as Benjamin Franklin, Alessandro Volta, Charles de Coulomb and André-Marie Ampere – discovered electromagnetic and magnetoelectric induction. Put simply, this was the basis of the dynamo and hence the electric motor; and it was this step, more than any other, which transformed the study of electricity from a science of observation to one of production and usage. Faraday’s discovery was the foundation of modern electricity, and set out the principles by which electrical power could be generated.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">With a potential power source available, early interest naturally revolved around the creation of a new lighting system. The early developers of electric light followed two distinct paths: electric arc lighting and the incandescent lamp. The former made much of the early running. In 1848 a demonstration of the carbon arc lamp had been made at the National Gallery in London. Strictly speaking, this experiment proved unsuccessful, as the fuel cells were unable to provide sufficient power at reasonable cost.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">But, in a broader sense, the early demonstrations were a success. They seized the public’s attention and raised the exciting prospect of a revolution in lighting. Between 1856 and 1870, a series of lighthouses in Britain were fitted with carbon arc lights, and further innovations in electric lighting were not long in coming. In 1878, lights were strung between Waterloo and Westminster Bridges in London, and a soccer match was illuminated at Sheffield’s Bramall Lane.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In economic terms, this nascent electric light industry was competing against an incumbent gas lighting system, which had substantial sunk cost and was therefore bound to be difficult to dislodge. Any new company seeking to displace gas lighting needed to show the clear advantage of its product if it was to be successful in raising funding.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Arc lighting was the first type of electric light to be taken up and promoted as a commercial alternative to gaslight. The principle of arc lighting had been demonstrated by Humphry Davy as far back as 1808, when a brilliant arc light was produced by bringing together two pieces of coal connected to a battery. Further development allowed the arc light to be used in other demonstrations, for example at an 1844 production at the Paris Opera. However, arc lighting technology was inhibited by the huge cost of batteries and the noxious fumes produced by combusting carbon.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">In the 1860s, Alexander de Lodyguine lit the St Petersburg dockyards with arc lighting that he immersed in an inert gas to retard consumption. But it was his fellow Russian, Paul Jablochkoff, a telegraph engineer working in Paris, whose lamps first grabbed the world’s attention. The ‘Jablochkoff Candles’ used a cluster of carbon rods in each of a group of lamps. This allowed the continuous production of an electric light of much sharper quality than the existing gas lamps. These lamps were used to illuminate the Grands Magasins du Louvre in Paris in 1877. In 1878 commercial trials were run in Britain at Weston-super-Mare, where six Jablochkoff Candles were run for 96 hours at a cost of £40 9s 5d (or $4,500 in today’s figures). This was more than two and a half times the cost of the equivalent gas lighting. It meant that arc lighting was still substantially more expensive than gas, which was already prohibitively expensive for wide-scale use. In the USA, Charles F. Brush had developed a different, though equivalent, system to Jablochkoff, and installed it in John Wanamaker’s department store in Philadelphia. The light met with much enthusiasm and a number of orders for its installation. These orders were not restricted to the US; for example, the British Navy ordered a system from the Brush Company. Given the degree of economic nationalism in government at the time, this speaks highly for the regard Brush’s technology commanded.</span> </p>
