<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The large number of telephone companies which sprang up in the ten years after the formation of the Bell companies were prone to disappear. Patent protection proved its worth, although continuous and large-scale litigation was necessary to enforce them. Despite the cost of the legal protection, the companies prospered. As telephone penetration increased, so did the profits of American Bell and its operating subsidiaries. The return on investment from expansion was high, and the barriers to entry allowed market segmentation with different price points for each segment. This situation could not endure indefinitely, and the American Bell Telephone Company was well aware of the potentially transitory nature of its success. Bell knew that the 17 years before the patent expired in 1893–4 had to be utilised to the full, to accumulate profits and build a protected position. American Bell incorporated AT&amp;T in 1885 to raise further capital to fund its continued expansion and protect its market position.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">A number of different tactics were used to protect its market expansion. Firstly, non-Western Electric equipment was banned from Bell lines. Second, Western Electric refused to sell its equipment to competitors of Bell. Third, long-distance interconnection between independent phone companies via Bell lines was prohibited. The response from independent companies salivating at the profits and growth potential of the industry was predictable. Since Western Electric equipment could not be purchased by the independents, new producers of equipment emerged. By the mid-1890s, sentiment had turned against the Bell companies, at a time when the remaining patents – the ‘Berliner’ patents – were nowhere near as robust as the original Bell ones. As a consequence, the patents provided little by way of a barrier to new entrants and were not sustained in the courts. The market for new equipment proved sufficiently large that these new producers could survive quite happily without selling to Bell companies.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The refusal by the Bell companies to allow connection of non-Bell networks to the Bell local and national systems served a purpose to some extent, in that it effectively isolated all non-Bell subscribers. The result was that two different telephone systems developed in many areas. The decision on which system to subscribe to depended upon which system one’s friends were on. In the urban areas, this led to social stratification, as most early subscribers were typically wealthy citizens already on the Bell system, while new subscribers went to the independents.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">As competition intensified and the patent expiries loomed, Bell’s tactics shifted to include fresh weapons. The company’s pricing policies had until now allowed a degree of market segmentation. Now it gradually lowered its prices, entering the middle and lower market segments where the independents had largely operated. Bell also accelerated the expansion of the telephone system to give comprehensive market coverage. Throughout the early 1900s, its main competitive response was to offer increasingly competitive pricing in any districts where the independents appeared to be gaining ground. In some areas prices would halve and halve again within a 12-month period. This tactic was soon augmented by a drive to increase the rate of business growth in a bid to reduce the opportunities for new entrants, and by moves to take control of competitors, either publicly or secretly. By the late 1890s American Bell had become AT&amp;T, and moved its incorporation and headquarters to New York, where laws were less restrictive than in Massachusetts. As regards the acquisition of competitors, the company was greatly influenced by J. P. Morgan, the financier. He had increased his holdings in AT&amp;T and repeatedly pushed for the company to develop as much of a stranglehold on the market as possible.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The competitive threat was sufficiently strong for AT&amp;T and its licencees to be drawn into a number of nefarious schemes to thwart the ambitions of the independents. One such alleged scheme was planned with the rival equipment manufacturer Kellog, by which AT&amp;T would quietly acquire control of Kellog and enter into a patent suit against them. Kellog would deliberately lose, and thus allow AT&amp;T to remove Kellog equipment from the independents. This scheme was thwarted when it came to light in mid-1903 that AT&amp;T had effectively controlled Kellog Switchboard for the preceding 18 months. Other schemes involved setting up supposedly independent competition, while AT&amp;T actually retained control. The period of the early 1900s was therefore one of continued growth, but set against a backdrop of increased competition and decreasing balance sheet strength, as funds were utilised to underpin growth and undermine or acquire competitors.</span> </p>
