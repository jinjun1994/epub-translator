<h1 id="anchor_1988_0"><span class="style1">The world beyond Pennsylvania</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">That oil seeped out of the ground in various parts of the world had been known for centuries. However, it was only when a reliable end product had developed that entrepreneurs began seriously to seek to exploit this knowledge. In the 1870s Sweden’s Nobel brothers had begun to build refineries in the Russian Empire to produce kerosene from the oilfields around the Caspian Sea. In 1879, they began shipping refined product from Baku to Western Europe. As in Oil Creek, when the oil wells began to pump out huge quantities of oil, transportation links were quickly constructed to move the refined product to the waiting markets.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Nobel brothers were soon joined in the business by the Rothschilds. As the crude oil in Baku was cheap and abundant it was not long before Russian oil production exceeded that of America. New refiners came into the business. In 1891, Marcus Samuel formed a marketing agreement with the Rothschilds to supply their kerosene to Asian markets through the Suez Canal. The advantage here was that the shipping time for Russian kerosene was one quarter that of American kerosene. Samuel named his company after the old family business of selling seashell boxes, calling it Shell Transport and Trading. His major competitor in Asia was a company formed to find fields in Sumatra and later reserves in the Dutch East Indies. This company was named Royal Dutch.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Standard Oil reacted to these threats as it had always done. It raised questions about the quality of its competitors’ kerosene and prevented Russian-produced kerosene from entering the American market. It tried to block sales in Europe and even attempted to use anti-Semitic sentiment to harm the Rothschild/Samuel <span id="anchor_1994_49"></span>business.<a href="ch80.html#anchor_2163_0">⁴⁶</a> The fact was, however, that outside the US, Standard Oil could not control refineries or transportation in the same way. The new competitors had too much influence to allow this to happen. When Standard Oil tried to buy out its competitors, it failed. With the emergence of powerful new international competitors, the industry was never again to be the monopoly preserve of one company.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The victory for Standard Oil’s competitors did not come easily, however. For Marcus Samuel it had been a carefully planned and high-risk campaign. Samuel had accumulated a fortune through his trade with the Scottish trading houses of Asia, and this successful association enabled him to persuade them to finance his new venture in the transportation of Russian kerosene to the Asian markets. He had clearly seen from Standard Oil’s experience the necessity of controlling the transportation chain and ensuring that it conferred an immediate cost advantage. He was also well aware that Standard Oil reacted to threats of new supply by introducing predatory pricing and subsidising this with profits earned in its more protected markets. His solution was to obtain efficient transportation and attack in all markets simultaneously, to prevent Standard Oil’s pricing response being sustainable. In complete secrecy, Samuel constructed a fleet of modern tankers and in 1891 negotiated a supply deal with the Rothschilds to sell kerosene east of the Suez Canal.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The London solicitors retained by Standard Oil responded by suggesting that the use of the Suez Canal for this purpose might be against the national interest. Samuel was able to marshal considerable political support through his alliance with the Rothschilds, a banking group whose British branch had assisted Prime Minister Disraeli in the purchase of the canal in 1875. The British government was unimpressed by Standard Oil’s disguised attempt to prevent Samuel’s venture. Approval for use of the canal was given. Samuel then moved sufficiently swiftly to deliver product to Asia that Standard Oil was unable to employ its normal pricing and volume responses. Standard Oil’s reach was long, but it was not long enough to break the political and financial support for Shell in Britain.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Standard Oil remained in effective control of the expanding US market, but faced a new threat from the discovery of fields in Oklahoma, California and Texas. Just as the markets in Europe and Asia were more difficult to control, so also were oil discoveries in the US that fell beyond the immediate reach of the distribution network controlled by Standard Oil. In the 1890s, previous unsuccessful ventures in California were eclipsed when more fields were discovered in the San Joaquin Valley. Within ten years, California had outstripped the now declining fields of Pennsylvania, and accounted for nearly a quarter of total global production. Standard Oil managed to make inroads into this new area, but other players provided meaningful competition in the Pacific Coast market. In California, a number of small players merged in late 1890 to form Union Oil (Unocal) of California, with initial assets of just over $5m ($360m). Expansion during the company’s first decade was relatively sedate. It was not until the early 1900s that Union Oil began to expand on a significant scale.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">California was one of the more competitive domestic US markets. This is not to say that Standard Oil’s brooding presence was not felt by local companies. That Unocal felt permanently under threat is readily apparent from the company’s financial statements of the time. The company made repeated reference to its independence from Standard Oil, while at the same time making veiled reference to the need for secrecy in terms of providing shareholders with financial information. The company appeared acutely aware of the potentially predatory nature of Standard Oil and the financial statistics it released were sparse.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style1">Unocal released little financial information, even to its shareholders. The company stated in its reports that “it was not deemed wise to publish a full financial report”. The shareholders’ funds are provided, and some indication of the fixed debt, in the shape of guarantees on the debt of wholly owned subsidiaries. So far as floating debt is concerned, the company treats it in a fairly oblique manner. In some annual reports, the shareholder is simply told not to worry, in others it is noted that cash plus inventories plus receivables would be sufficient to liquidate the entire amount. Given that this ignores payables, and given the likely size of inventories, this is not exactly reassuring. The financial condition of the company was presumably a sensitive matter given the potential predatory nature of Standard Oil. The company was moved to explicitly renounce any affiliation with Standard Oil in its 1906 annual report and on other occasions take an even more pious line: “amongst the causes for gratitude we have special reasons for thankfulness that the Lord has kept your Company from business entanglements and unlawful alliances”. It was not solely through restricting financial information that Unocal was protected. Over the years, the share structure of Unocal was altered to provide an additional protective umbrella, with a twin company structure set up to inhibit any predatory intentions from Standard Oil.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Unocal was formed in October 1890 from the merger of three companies, the assets of which were transferred to the new company in return for a shareholding comparable to the assets injected. In the absence of definitive financial statements, the investor would have been required to put together his own set of figures. The financial position of the company looks to have been somewhat stretched, and from the oblique comments in the shareholder letters it is likely that the debt/equity ratio exceeded 100%. The company was in one of the fastest-growing regions, which is reflected in the growth in earnings. To an extent, therefore, the pressure on the balance sheet was the result of the company’s expansion. The profitability of the company remained relatively strong, with operating income growing at a compound rate of roughly 35% per annum and net income at about 25%. The difference between the two was a result of the growing interest burden on the increased indebtedness. Earnings per share growth was also strong, though reduced by the interest cost of debt and the issue of new shares. A compounding annual growth rate of around 20% was recorded. These figures have to be estimated, since the interest charge facing the company was frequently not revealed. It should also be noted that the depreciation charge levied by the company on its assets at 2% was at only one third of that applied by Standard Oil. Equally, though the company was happy to give estimates of asset value (circa $15m) that incorporated the estimated value of reserves (not the book value or cost of finding them), little account was paid to reserve depletion, although in the context of the time this would not have been unreasonable. The main point is that the company’s net income figures would have been compiled on a different basis from those of Standard Oil. The latter wanted to reduce its profits for public consumption: the former wanted to do the opposite. It is tough to say exactly what sort of margins the company would have been earning, but in all likelihood at the operating level it would have been in the 30–40% range, and at the net income level somewhere around 20%. In other words, not very different from what is earned today by exploration and production companies with quality onshore assets. The main difference is that the top line was experiencing relatively rapid growth driven by increased demand as well as new reservoir finds.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The pattern of income growth showed that demand was not unaffected by either economic or industry conditions. When the economy hit a rough patch in 1907, demand for oil products briefly turned down. Equally, as more and more sources of oil in California came on-stream after 1911, pricing fell sharply, reducing revenues – only to then turn up again as the impact of World War I increased demand. Aside from the issues of the economic cycle and new discoveries, the greatest threat to the company was probably correctly perceived by management as the overpowering embrace of Standard Oil. After 1911 this threat become more a competitive one than that of being absorbed. The company was impacted by the change in competitive conditions and on more than one occasion the need to service on- and off-balance-sheet debt led to the dividend being passed. For the investor, Unocal would have been seen as a company in a growing industry located in a growing region. These were attractive features, but the region was also a competitive one and the company did suffer from its relative lack of financial resources. Despite this it should have been an attractive investment, but with the proviso that the shares tended to be rated on the back of their dividend-paying ability, rather than in relation to net assets. Given the dividend history, the share price was no doubt somewhat more volatile than others with better payout records.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The major outlets for the California wells were the emerging markets of Asia, as the product could be shipped directly across the Pacific. To supply the markets and ports of America’s eastern seaboard, though, other fields needed to be found. Texas proved to be the next big source of supply, with the 1901 discovery of oil in the form of a huge 75,000-barrel-per-day gusher at ‘Spindletop’. The prospect of instant riches acted as an overpowering magnet, just as it had in Pennsylvania. There are contemporary estimates of 16,000 people living in tents on Spindletop Hill. The excitement that was generated led to the normal excesses. Shares were sold not only in newly created companies that wanted to drill for oil, but also in companies which were nothing other than outright frauds. There was, for example, a company formed to promote a youth with ‘x-ray’ vision who could point out the spots to <span id="anchor_2021_153"></span>drill.<a href="ch80.html#anchor_2164_0">⁴⁷</a> Such was the volume of frauds that, for some, the discovery came to be known as ‘Swindletop’. The find did stimulate Shell, however, to negotiate immediate rights to half of the production of the area. Not long after the discoveries in Texas, fields were also discovered and developed in Louisiana and Oklahoma. These discoveries gave birth to new companies such as Texaco and Sun Oil, and created or enlarged fortunes for financiers such as William Mellon, who helped create the Gulf Oil Corporation.</span> </p>
