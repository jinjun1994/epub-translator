<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The economic impact of technological change is distinctly mixed. In the short term it is positive in the sense that it typically contributes to higher economic growth, as part of the invested capital devoted to the technology is effectively converted into consumption. This tends to bolster the feelings of wellbeing which surround strong capital markets. However, in due course the new businesses reach the point where their cash burn rate can no longer be sustained and new capital is no longer forthcoming. In aggregate, the new businesses contribute little to the stock of productive capital because of duplication, the costs of raising capital and the costs of maintaining necessary propaganda.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the medium term, the impact is more likely to be negative than positive. The destruction of capital that follows a period of over-investment creates the need for a reduction in consumption and a rise in the savings rate to repair the stock of available capital for future funding. Survivor companies refund and retrench such that their overall contribution to economic growth is negligible, and is counterbalanced by their competitive impact on existing companies.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As a side effect, inflation tends to be lowered, although it is the reaction of the monetary authorities that determines whether the ultimate outcome is inflation or deflation. In most cases, excess capacity is created by the funding of new infrastructure, and this has to be written down or depleted before the economic impact can be finally measured. Employment patterns meanwhile have to change, which creates problems of adjustment for those parts of the labour market most adversely affected.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the long term, however, the process is generally positive for the economy. New technology delivers more efficient production and distribution, raising growth rates and the standard of living. More than 60 years ago, Joseph Schumpeter described how a process of ‘creative destruction’ enabled the capitalist system to regenerate itself at periodic intervals. Technological change is the handmaiden of that process, and there is nothing planned or pre-determined about its effects, judging by the history of previous episodes.</span> </p>
