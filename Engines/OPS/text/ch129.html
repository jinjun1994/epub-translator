<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The two ex-Moore scientists had offers of employment, including one from IBM, but concern over operational independence pushed them into forming their own operation. Although companies had shown an interest in the two scientists, there was little recognition of the potential market for computers. Thomas Watson allegedly believed in the late 1940s that the total marketplace for computers extended to not much more than 12 machines. The consensus of the time was still that computers were essentially large, expensive specialised machines with little practical application outside a limited sphere dominated by government uses. Having decided to set up business on their own, Mauchly and Eckert established a partnership that soon became a limited liability company. Their first priority was to find capital to finance the building of a computer with similar properties to that set out in the EDVAC proposal. The new version was named the Universal Automatic Computer, or UNIVAC. The founders had to persuade prospective providers of funds that their technology was sound, deliverable and had a ready customer base. They also had to persuade potential clients of their financial solvency before any would be willing to commit resources and tie themselves to such a new project.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This was a classic chicken-and-egg situation: customers wanted to see committed financial resources and the providers of financial resources wanted to see committed customers. Either the providers of capital or the customers had to be willing to take on trust the assurance of the founders that the other would be forthcoming. The process tends to be much smoother if the principals have a prior record of commercial success. If the principals have spent their lives in academic or government work, persuasion can be difficult. Mauchly and Eckert struggled to raise sufficient funds to capitalise their new venture. Initial funding of $20,000 ($215,000) came from Eckert’s father, a further $200,000 ($2.5m) was raised from other contacts in the Philadelphia area, and in March 1946 the Electronic Control Company (ECC) was formed. Following the example of Hollerith 50 years before, the two founders approached one of the largest peacetime users of computational equipment, the Census Bureau. The bureau was prohibited by federal law from funding research directly and decided to use the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) as a conduit through which to fund the UNIVAC machine.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The negotiations between ECC and the Census Bureau resulted in a contract with NBS which provided for payment of $300,000, less 15% for NBS. As Mauchly and Eckert had budgeted for expenses of $400,000, even from the outset the project was scheduled to lose approximately $125,000 (over $1.5m). This was not necessarily commercial suicide, as the cost figures included the research and development costs which could be amortised over future sales of UNIVACs. The real key remained perceptions. Potential customers had to be confident of the solvency of the company and its ability to deliver the specified product on a timely and financially sound basis. This made it vital that the initial cost estimates were accurate and contained a contingency reserve for cost overruns. Unfortunately, scepticism over the prospects for the UNIVAC meant ECC had little bargaining power. It had to settle for whatever it could get. Perhaps ECC could have negotiated a cost-plus contract, but since these contracts typically involved ceding control of any patents they would effectively have reduced ECC to a subcontractor in the work it was itself creating.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Scepticism about the UNIVAC stemmed from the same source that Mauchly and Eckert had encountered in their work on ENIAC. The head of NBS referred the project to the National Research Council for an opinion. It was not supportive. This might have been because the group giving the opinion was itself involved in competitive work or had good reasons to delay the <span id="anchor_3510_63"></span>project.<a href="ch135.html#anchor_3645_0">⁸²</a> While the NBS remained committed to the project, the report of the NRC was damaging. The net result was that the project began life undercapitalised and with insufficient cash flow to sustain it. As a consequence, the company struggled continually to find ways of obtaining funds to continue the development process. Eventually the principals lost control of their company.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Mauchly’s first step was to agree to build a small computer to operate a guidance system for a new military aircraft being built by Northrop. While the contract for this computer, the BINAC, brought in additional funds, it also distracted attention from the hard-pressed team at ECC. Worse still, the final cost of completing the contract was over two and a half times the $100,000 in revenue it generated. If this was not bad enough, as the focus of the company then shifted back to the UNIVAC, there was no follow-up on the BINAC and therefore no sales of similar machines to offset the development cost. The BINAC project was not totally without value as it did generate publicity. However, the publicity was limited and restricted to short commentaries on the machine, rather than highlighting its commercial prospects. As a consequence, BINAC failed to deliver either visibility or cashflow.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The funding need remained pressing and a degree of salvation for the company, now named the Eckert-Mauchly Computing Corporation (EMCC), came with the injection of $0.5m by the American Totalisator Company, a group that exercised an effective monopoly on racecourse betting and required the computational power for obvious reasons. It took a 40% equity stake in return. The additional funds sustained EMCC for a period; further funds were received in the form of advance payments from new customers, including A. C. Neilsen, the market research company, and Prudential Insurance. The financial situation remained stretched, though, as research and development consumed capital. The desperation for funds was obvious to new customers, who demanded further fixed-price contracts on less than advantageous terms. The firm remained precariously in operation until the tragic death in an aircraft explosion of their principal supporter at the American Totalisator Company. At this point, the principal equity shareholders demanded either a refinancing from external sources or a sale of the business.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">After repeated efforts to raise new funding and in increasing desperation, Mauchly and Eckert sought to find a buyer for the business. A meeting with Thomas Watson at IBM failed to provide a home, partly due to IBM’s concern over the antitrust implications, and partly because of their belief that they could develop the resources internally. Although both NCR and Remington Rand showed an interest, the latter moved the quickest. The administrative head at Remington Rand, General Leslie Groves, had been aware of the role of ENIAC in the atomic project during the war and was thus familiar with the work of the two scientists. In 1950 EMCC was acquired for a payment of not much more than $500,000 ($5m) and with it the patent rights of the work that had been completed, as well as any future patents which would be forthcoming. The new owners then sought as far as was possible to renegotiate the outstanding contracts for UNIVAC machines. In March 1951 the UNIVAC was finally completed and passed its acceptance tests for the Census Bureau.</span> </p>
