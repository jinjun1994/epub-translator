<p><span class="style2">8.4 (a) and (b) – ‘A marvel of electric ingenuity’: the unveiling of the ENIAC computer</span> </p>
<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style1">New York Times</span><span class="style0">, 15 February 1946.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For Mauchly and Eckert, the public unveiling of ENIAC in February 1946 should have represented a triumph, but in reality, as supportive as the public reception was, it had already been pre-empted in the scientific community by Von Neumann’s EDVAC paper of the previous year. The whole question of precedent and the patenting of the work involved in ENIAC had also become an emotive subject. Mauchly and Eckert wished the work to be patented, as they believed it had commercial potential that could be exploited when the war ended. As sponsoring body, the army was also concerned at the lack of patent protection and the dangers of others working in the field pre-empting them with patents. A deal was reached whereby the patent would be taken by the inventors and the rights shared between them, the government and the university. Within the Moore School, even those who did not object to a patent application showed little interest in the application. This was only to change later as the commercial potential of the computer became more obvious. At the time the future uses of the technology were not clearly seen by scientists or businessmen.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Eventually, in 1947, a patent application relating to ENIAC was submitted. The delay stemmed from several things: desire to include as much in the application as possible, a wish to give the patent the longest possible period to expiry and also the relative inexperience of the parties involved. All of these factors later came back to haunt Mauchly and Eckert. One of the key issues in the commercial development of any technology is the creation of a barrier to entry for competitors. Rarely is the scientific lead of sufficient magnitude to represent a barrier in itself. In the absence of patent protection, the only barriers to entry are economic ones, associated with control of distribution, or economies of scale in production, and/or the protection offered by government on ‘national interest’ grounds.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">So far as the EDVAC was concerned, while the application for funding had been successful, the team at the Moore School was in the process of disintegrating. The display of ENIAC had been followed in 1946 by a series of lectures at the university where its properties were described to a large band of visiting scientists. By the end of the course, information on EDVAC was also supplied to several computer luminaries. This spurred development in Britain by scientists who had been involved in the computer code-breaking activities at Bletchley Park, and resulted in the construction of a working digital computer with stored programs at Cambridge University, which was named the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Computer (EDSAC). Britain and America were the only two countries actively involved at the forefront of computer research immediately after the war.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">For Mauchly and Eckert, their days at the Moore School were effectively ended by the question of patents. A new policy on patents was instituted by the recently appointed head of research, Irven Travis. This placed extremely restrictive covenants on academics and cut across the previous agreement on ENIAC and future EDVAC patents. The contracts offered to Mauchly and Eckert would have involved them renouncing their patent claims. This they deemed unacceptable. Given no other choice, they left the Moore School to seek alternative funding. As the two walked out the door, so did the university’s pre-eminence in the field of computing.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The patent issue did not finish there, however. The belief held by Mauchly and Eckert that they had an agreement regarding the EDVAC patents was shattered when Von Neumann tried to file patents based on the paper he had published under his own name. As the body sponsoring the research, the US Army tried to resolve the increasingly acrimonious dispute between the former three colleagues. The eventual resolution was unsatisfactory in as much as it proved impossible to reach a compromise on EDVAC. It was concluded that the paper circulated by Von Neumann represented a publication and since more than 12 months had elapsed since its distribution the information was technically in the public domain and therefore not eligible for patent protection.</span> </p>
