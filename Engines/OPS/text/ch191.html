<h1 id="anchor_5013_0"><span class="style1">What works and what does not</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The path of technological development is influenced by a large number of factors, but a relatively small subset stand out. Success or failure depends upon not only the ultimate intrinsic viability of the technology itself, but the speed and cost of its development, its deployment, its access to funding and its protection from competitors. Historically the repeated requirement for cash injections means that the company always finds itself in a race to reach a point where a convincing case can be made before capital runs out.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There is a constant battle between perception and financial necessity. Any hint of failure will be self-fulfilling, in that it will immediately shut down access to capital. To survive, the company must always be bullish about its prospects of success. As capital markets are influenced by the general level of optimism, success is also affected by the prevailing economic and monetary conditions.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In figure 11.1, the stages of development outlined above are presented schematically. What can be seen are the points at which funding is typically required. These represent potential crisis points for the company, since failure to raise the necessary funds means the game is over. Typically the level of funding rises for each successive stage, as the technology moves from feasibility demonstration to commercial deployment.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This means confidence levels also have to be raised, as increasing numbers of external investors need to be pulled in. Historically even ultimately successful companies have often been forced at some stage to offer to sell their technology in desperation at their inability to raise capital, only to scrape through to ultimate profitability. For example, Bell was forced to offer his patents to Western Union for $100,000 and was lucky that his offer was turned down. There was a point in Google’s history when it badly needed development capital and came close to surrendering control over its future development. We can only speculate how differently the shape of an industry might have developed had a different outcome occurred in these cases.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The terms investors can obtain also depend upon the stage of investment and overall market conditions. The earlier an investment, the greater the equity that is typically received, simply because there is a greater number of hurdles to be overcome on the way to profitability. In some cases, the process telescopes and profits appear quickly, reducing the number of necessary funding rounds. This mainly happens where a company succeeds in obtaining patent protection over the technology, although even this is not always sufficient to ensure success. If there are high capital costs, access to capital becomes of at least equal importance. Edison, AT&amp;T and the computer manufacturers all found this out. In the Internet boom, exceptionally, the opposite happened. Easy capital and availability of funds meant that companies were able to raise extraordinarily large sums purely on the promise of demonstrating feasibility. That sustained them well beyond the first phase of the typical development cycle – but did not in itself guarantee their ultimate success. The importance of retaining investors’ confidence returned with a vengeance when the day of reckoning could no longer be postponed.</span> </p>
