<h1 id="anchor_4037_0"><span class="style1">The PC business in perspective</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The assembly-driven structure of the personal computer industry was very similar to the early days of the automobile industry, when producers were effectively assemblers of externally produced components and financed purchases and production through credit and customer advances. The automobile industry transformed itself into a volume business when the automobile became a mass-market product and economic downturn culled most of the competition. The PC business was a volume-driven one almost from the start. Brand brand loyalty has been progressively removed by standardisation of components and software. Minor production or pricing errors can have an immediate and major impact on the income statement. Like the automotive industry, the PC business remains susceptible to an economic downturn. The lack of an inventory buffer means that any economic downturn will have an instantaneous impact on suppliers, and volatility throughout the supply chain will increase. The ‘shock’ element will therefore undoubtedly be much higher than hitherto. If this ‘shock’ were met with large-scale retrenchment, the overall economic impact would be amplified.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">While the software industry produced an industry colossus in Microsoft, the hardware industry continued its evolution from one driven by the economics of production to one driven instead by the economics of distribution. The standardisation of the personal computer, and its metamorphosis into an assembled item with ‘named’ components (most notably the microprocessor), meant that reliability became less of an issue. Consequently, the importance of the ‘PC’ brand name diminished and was replaced by the ubiquitous ‘Intel Inside’ as an effective product quality guarantee. As a consequence the principal factor became price, the price at which the PC could be delivered to the consumer.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">New companies emerged that had built operating models which minimised the costs associated with sales and after-sales service as well as through efficient production. Those that could move to the lowest point on the cost curve were in a position to make profits, those that could not reduce their costs to this lowest level had to operate on wafer-thin margins or even at a loss if they wished to retain market share. The personal computer industry became a commodity one, identical in most respects to the traditional ‘old’ industries of chemicals or steel. It used to be a ‘growth cyclical’ in the sense that the market was expanding at rates in excess of GDP growth. As a consequence, while it was prone to sharp swings in profitability and inventory requirement, there at least remained the comfort of underlying growth. This produced the apparently paradoxical situation of an industry with both growth characteristics and declining margins. The move to mobile devices has taken away this growth advantage so that PC producers are effectively now ‘old economy’.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The software industry was part of this enabling in the sense that just as ‘Intel Inside’ homogenised the hardware so ‘Windows’ did the same for the software, and between the two this effectively commoditised the PC. Applications have evolved, with some products having been overtaken by the development of their competitors – the most obvious example being VisiCalc being overtaken by Lotus 1-2-3, which in turn was overtaken by Microsoft Office – but the almost universal adoption of Windows created a form of monopoly protection. This was very similar to the barriers to entry that protected Bell, Edison and RCA.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">When VisiCalc was first produced, the application of the laws of patent and copyright to software was not obvious. However, it did not take long for developers to realise the need to protect their products if high margins were to be sustained. Equally, Apple, which had seized upon the work originated by Engelbart and others to produce a generational shift in the visual display and ease of use of programs, was unable to monopolise this work in the way that Microsoft was able to for the IBM-clone-based market.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Unlike the Apple market, which remained a relatively niche part of the overall personal computer sector, the IBM clone segment was the volume arena and Microsoft the provider of the operating, interface and applications software, with the former providing a huge benefit in the delivery of the latter. The strength of this position placed Microsoft in a monopolistic position in much the same manner that AT&amp;T controlled the early development of the telephone industry or Standard Oil the oil industry. The level of power this conferred brought an identical response from the competition authorities regarding potential abuse and predatory actions. Microsoft adopted a combative approach to the intrusion of regulators, although at various stages it was forced to allow access to third-party software. Nevertheless, history would have suggested that in the absence of meaningful concessions the end result of this would have been some form of enforced breakup. However, market forces can be more powerful than those of the regulator. The dominance of Microsoft’s position in operating systems was overtaken by events. The threat of the Internet was one which the company, bound by the legacy of its installed base, was not well-equipped to deal with. The history of the business had been in PCs; the future was in mobile devices. One might have expected that Microsoft had a competitive advantage because of customer familiarity with its operating system but in some ways this ended up being a disadvantage as new dedicated operating systems were created by competitors. In launching the iPhone Apple created a mobile interface (iPhone OS, later rebranded iOS) that was intuitive and simple to use, and opened the door to the creation of a family of products linked through its closed ecosystem, which included iTunes and the Apps Store. Google sought to protect its search revenues by purchasing and further developing a mobile operating system (Android) that embedded the use of its search engine, which it complemented with its own apps ecosystem and maps services.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Technological evolution has made the monopoly question much less pressing for Microsoft but the bull’s eye that was on its chest has moved to new targets. It is worth remembering that Standard Oil’s response was to fall back on legal argument, resist the overtures of government and seek to counter the persistent attacks in state and federal courts. The eventual outcome was the breakup of the trust into its constituent companies. For the investor, this outcome was not a damaging one, since the individual entities were sufficiently large in size to become profitable and growing companies in their own right. As a consequence, it did not prove a financial penalty for Rockefeller either. What was decisive to the profitability of the industry was its control over distribution and pricing. This was partially removed by the breakup, but more than compensated for by the fact that the breakup occurred just as the automobile industry was moving into a period of rapid growth.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">So far as AT&amp;T was concerned, in the J. P. Morgan/Theodore Vail era, the approach adopted by government competition concerns was conciliatory. AT&amp;T acquiesced to a degree of federal control, and as a consequence managed to retain the local and long-distance networks and the virtual monopoly that these conferred. Part of the penalty for this was that the company had to be very careful about what it did in related fields. Many potential growth opportunities that came out of the research in Bell Laboratories were left to be exploited by others. While Microsoft no longer retains the same level of monopoly control despite the persistence of Windows and Office, it is still worth remembering the degree of animosity felt towards the company during the late 1990s.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Summarising the structure of the personal computer industry at the turn of the century is probably most easily achieved by reference to the margins earned by the different players. Figure 9.17 clearly shows the dominance of Microsoft and Intel, even by comparison with Dell, the most successful new entrant. On the hardware side, it was Intel microprocessors that largely defined the hardware. On the software side, it was the Microsoft family of products which the consumer identified.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Dominance of this magnitude could not continue indefinitely. At the time Intel had had competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), whose products frequently rivalled those of Intel. However, AMD’s challenges proved to be short-lived if persistent. Barriers to entry had risen since the early years, though, when intellectual and technical capability were the dominant characteristics. Such is the sophistication and precision of the end product that these earlier characteristics have been overlaid with the demands of process technology, yield and capital. A single production facility would now cost in excess of $1bn to build, which presents a formidable barrier to most potential entrants, who would not only need to find such capital but also sustain volume production against entrenched players with heavy setup costs. The shift to mobile proved difficult for Microsoft, as it also did for Intel. Despite repeated attempts Intel found it had ceded leadership to ARM in mobile chips design in a world where designers designed and fabricators produced.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">When compared with other technological advances, the personal computer industry can be seen as an offshoot from the mainstream development work largely funded by government defence requirements. This development work produced technologies that were picked up by groups of individuals who sought to transform them into a viable commercial product. From that point the traditional cycle of innovation, propaganda, retrenchment, failure and ultimate success was rejoined. Many companies had periods of temporary success, but ultimately only a small number of players emerged as long-term success stories. As in previous technological waves, the common feature of those that made it was the ability to build barriers to entry.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style0">Annual reports of Dell, Compaq, Apple, IBM, Microsoft and Intel.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the personal computing industry, IBM helped to create the mass market, but the manner in which it did so created an industry which transformed itself into an assembly business driven mainly by cost. Part of this development was the creation of what could be termed ‘integrators’, or perhaps quality control checks, in Intel and Microsoft. Because of their superior technology and/or market knowledge, Intel and Microsoft became part of a select band whose profit margins remained protected by these barriers to entry. The barriers to entry were effective until they were circumvented by a product shift away from desktop to mobile. Both companies failed to manage the transition and lost leadership as a consequence. Their historic business remained reasonably robust but without the growth that had been diverted to the new areas.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The other element that comes clearly out of the PC story is how difficult it is to forecast future developments at times of profound shifts in technological capabilities. These shifts were rarely foreseen, even by those whose scientific work helped to create them. As a result, commercial implications entered rarely into financial analysis and valuation work. Once the initial shifts took place, however, those such as Gates who had the clearest vision and the drive to exploit it were to find the path an extraordinarily profitable one. However, the circle of life continued and another ‘initial shift’ followed which was again exploited by those who had the vision, drive and perhaps good fortune.</span> </p>
