<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style1">Financial Times</span><span class="style0">, 12 August 1983 and 13 May 1983.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The press articles of the time reveal the extent to which Bill Gates of Microsoft understood how the industry was likely to evolve and how he would position his company to take advantage. The evolution of Windows and later the ‘Office’ suite of programs was relatively straightforward, in the sense that each of them took the best features of existing products and sought to ensure their compatibility and ease of use. While Windows represented a rapid reaction to the development of the Apple Mac, Office was designed from the outset as a natural complement to Windows. Underpinning the strength of Microsoft was the original deal signed between Bill Gates and IBM, a deal that established Microsoft as the platform provider for the IBM-compatible market, and over which Gates’s vision of the development of the PC industry could be overlaid. The vision of Gates underpinned the company’s approach to development, in particular the need to provide product integration. Microsoft reacted quickly to market developments and from its powerbase, MS-DOS, was able to recreate the best attributes of rival products. Just as Apple had augmented the GUI work of Xerox PARC’s facility, so Microsoft eventually created Windows. Just as Lotus had improved upon VisiCalc, so Excel, within the Office suite of programs, brought an improved integrated alternative.</span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">Microsoft</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">On 13 March 1986 the prospectus for Microsoft Corporation was issued by the joint underwriters Goldman Sachs and Alex. Brown. A total of approximately $60m was to be raised, with two thirds being capital raised for the company and the $15m remainder going to selling shareholders. Existing shareholders retained ownership of over 90% of the company. The IPO price was $21, giving the debt-free company a valuation of just over six times tangible book value, four times sales, 20 times historic earnings and roughly 14 times prospective earnings. The implied market capitalisation of the flotation was therefore some $520m.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The competitive environment at the time was outlined in the document, most notably the rapid pace of technology and the danger of obsolescence and the plethora of competitors, ranging from large corporations such as AT&amp;T, Digital and Xerox to dedicated PC producers such as Apple and established software concerns such as Lotus Development and Borland International. On top of the competitive threats there was also outstanding litigation from Seattle Computer Products (SCP), the company from whose product MS-DOS had been developed. SCP was demanding relief in regards of its interpretation of the violation of the agreement it had signed with Microsoft in 1981. In the prospectus Microsoft noted its view that the interpretation of the prior agreement was erroneous and its belief that the outcome would not materially impact its business. Notwithstanding the guarded reassurance, given the importance of MS-DOS to Microsoft the legal threat would undoubtedly have been an issue for investors.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">In terms of product development the major releases were Excel, a new integrated spreadsheet product for the Apple Macintosh, and Windows, the MS-DOS GUI. The prospectus did not place particularly strong emphasis on these products. They appeared simply as part of a long list of Microsoft operating and applications products. The spreadsheet package Multiplan, for example, received substantially more attention than Excel in the discussion, the latter being discussed in terms of its application as tool for the Apple computers.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The investor was therefore faced with a decision about a company with a multiple-product range in an evolving software industry where thus far longevity had not been a feature. The core product of the company was an operating system which constituted the industry standard, but only because of its adoption by IBM, a company which had in the past shown its ability to adapt and eventually create competitive products which would overtake the lead of new entrants (e.g. UNIVAC and later the personal computer). History would not have sided with a company the size of Microsoft on the presumption that IBM would seek to reclaim control of the operating system once its strategic importance and profitability became obvious.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The financial results of Microsoft, though, are testament to the ferocious way in which the company protected its position through both litigation and product development. The company saw rapid growth in sales combined with strengthening margins and stable returns on capital and equity. These stable returns were similar only to those earned by businesses who have achieved meaningful barriers to entry through some form of protection, whether it be by patent or market power.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The encroachment of Microsoft was not lost on Apple and it was not long before the question of patent infringement by Windows became the subject of litigation. The question was not about who had the original vision of an icon-based, user-friendly multimedia set-up; this belonged to Engelbart many years before. The question was a more simple commercial one. Did Apple’s copyright protect it from the development work of Microsoft? The legal question was more complicated than this because, while Apple sued Microsoft, Xerox was also suing Apple. The eventual outcome was that Microsoft was free to develop the Windows GUI.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It was not just Apple that sought to protect its position. Lotus Corporation filed multiple suits against competitors, including Paperback Software, Mosaic and Borland. The common theme in the increasingly litigious computing industry was the need to protect market share and margins. Just as previous technological advances had proved to be capable of being reproduced by large numbers of competitors, so the personal computer market became one with very low barriers to entry, particularly on the software side where the principal capital required was human intellectual capability rather than financial. As in all such cases, the most obvious response to encroachment was to seek the court’s assistance in the protection of intellectual property rights.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The irony is that virtually none of the major protagonists had actually developed their products from first principles. Most had taken the work of others and refined it to a commercial product. The ‘inventors’ were not engaged in basic research in the manner of, say, an Edison or a Bell. This does not negate the innovative work that they conducted, but it places it in a specifically commercial context. Gates’s vision was the clearest and he pursued it most aggressively. Microsoft also had the advantage of its control over MS-DOS, which others were simply unable to overcome. Most likely all these factors played a role, but the outcome was unequivocal: Microsoft emerged as the industry giant at the time, with margins that only small specialist niche players were able to match. Early leaders in the industry became very much second-tier players by comparison. Lotus, for example, was purchased by IBM in an effort by the previous industry giant to try and regain some of its former dominance. Not only did Microsoft emerge as the software industry giant, but it also successfully drove a wedge between hardware and software. Consumers could now purchase virtually any personal computer they wanted as long as it had Microsoft software. The commercial logic behind the personal computer industry was inescapable, and this allowed the emergence of new companies, the entire structures of which were built on the principle of cost-curve position. Most notable among them was the company formed by Michael Dell, who clearly articulated the financial proposition of the changing economics of PC production.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">By 2000 the personal computer industry had become one where high margins were earned only by those with a stake in the branded components of the PC. By and large the PC itself is not a branded product. It was Intel and Microsoft, the dominant suppliers of chips and software respectively, who had come closest to monopoly positions, with large market shares in their market segments. It is difficult to provide direct analogies with other industries, since most products are differentiated by what they do, how they work, how they look, how much they cost and what after-sales service they provide. External styling had rarely been a major differentiating factor for PCs, and after-sales service diminished in importance when reliability levels increased and PCs became increasingly homogeneous with many common components. The producers of personal computers have therefore had to compete increasingly on price alone. This changed the whole structure of the industry, as it meant that growth on its own did not necessarily produce high profit margins. This had nothing to do with globalisation and the new economy, and everything to do with the development of Intel and Microsoft as industry ‘equalisers’.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The impact on industry structure can be seen in two ways. Firstly, just as Compaq provided a lower-cost alternative to IBM, so it too came under threat later from another low-cost producer. The difference was that Dell was not simply a low-cost producer, but also a low-cost supplier, having extended the logic of low cost from the production chain into the distribution channel. Dell emerged just as mail order reached new heights. In a world where the supply chains could be constructed in electronic form and integrated with production, it was suddenly possible to remove large elements of cost from the system. This took the form not only of reduced administration and bureaucracy, but also much lower working capital requirements (work in progress and inventory). Since PC production was largely an assembly process, if the components could be moved onto a ‘just in time’ basis there would no longer be the same levels of capital and cost involved in holding components. This change in the industry, and the importance of the cost curve, can be seen in the way in which Dell overtook Compaq (figure 9.15). Dell fully exploited the importance of being the low-cost producer, but was unable to escape the accompanying logic. Irrespective of how efficient it became, it remained in a low-margin, high-volume business, which was therefore sensitive to the whims of the economic cycle. Growth might remain strong, but would be cyclical; the margins would be retained by those with proprietary products.</span> </p>
