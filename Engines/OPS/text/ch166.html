<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The arrival of an easy-to-use browser paved the way for the growth of Internet service providers (ISPs) as the Web became accessible for more and more people. Until then, the history of service providers had been one of recurrent failure and a battle for survival, not the untrammelled growth which was to follow. Indeed, the service-provision model was arguably the product of repeated failures in other attempts to harness the new medium. The birth of AOL was a result of one of the ventures of a serial technology entrepreneur named Bill von Meister. Von Meister had raised funds for a succession of businesses, including photoelectric aids for security services and, in the mid-1970s, a switch-based cost-reduction system for telecommunications companies. So frequent were his ideas, and so little their success, that he was nicknamed the ‘Von Meister Shyster’. It was not that the concepts themselves were necessarily poor (although some were), but that his operating model seemed to consist of raising capital and then spending it as fast as possible before moving on to the next vision. The telecoms cost-reduction company TDX, for example, was eventually purchased by its major shareholder, Cable and Wireless, and turned into a successful business; but only after Von Meister had been bought out and removed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Von Meister’s next company was based on a vision of linking homes to central computers to deliver services. This was a vision which had existed for many years and been expounded during the heady days of timeshare computing. The first attempt at creating this business ended (yet again) with Von Meister being bought out by disgruntled investors. Enthusiasm undiminished, he moved on to a new variant: the delivery of music via satellite and cable to the home. Again this was not a new idea, as home delivery of music had been tried through the telephone 70 years before. The company he formed to do this was named Home Music Store. He also hired a programmer with ARPANET experience named Marc Seriff. This venture failed when the record distribution industry reacted to the threat and the major recording companies quickly withdrew their support.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Undeterred, Von Meister moved on to the next hot area, computer games. Again the concept was to deliver games to the home electronically. Again Von Meister set out with unbridled enthusiasm to raise funds, this time from some of the premier venture capital funds. Kleiner Perkins and Hambrecht &amp; Quist both invested in the company known as Control Video Corporation. Offices were established in Vienna, Virginia. In the early days, controls on expenditure were relatively tight – but this discipline soon faded. The early period looked promising as deals were signed and an IPO planned. Unfortunately this excitement disappeared when the lucrative market for video games became engulfed by competition, forcing a postponement of the IPO and its eventual abandonment. Von Meister was undeterred, and continued down his normal path, once again culminating in his removal from the company.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">A new figure was brought in to CVC to sort out the mess. Jim Kimsey was a friend of one of the principal investors, a West Point graduate and Vietnam veteran. Working with Kimsey at that time were Steve Case, brother of Dan Case (the Hambrecht &amp; Quist representative), and Marc Seriff. They had to figure out how to create a viable business from the debris. What followed was a constant battle to retain solvency. This involved successive deals with Bell South, Commodore and Apple. Driven by commercial necessity, CVC edged towards a niche market in online services. The team had also become battle-hardened by its experiences and recognised the need to diversify its customer base, particularly not to limit itself to one PC manufacturer.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">CVC was not alone in this market. IBM and Sears had set up a service named Prodigy, and there was also CompuServe, owned by H&amp;R Block Inc., the tax advice specialists, and a latent threat from the telecommunication companies, who were all considering the provision of such a service. By 1991 CVC had changed its named to Quantum Computer Services and had grown its customer base to just over 100,000. The online service it provided was known as America Online (AOL). Quantum had reached yet another potential decision point. In this case, the decision was either to be sold or go to the stock market to raise new capital. The main potential purchaser was CompuServe, which made an offer of $50m, some $10m less than Kimsey was willing to accept. The shortfall in the offer, combined with Steve Case’s resistance to the sale, led to the decision to take the company public instead.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Quantum changed its name to AOL and in March 1992 an IPO took place. At that time its number of subscribers had grown to 155,000. A total of $23m was raised, of which $11m went to those selling shares in the offer and $10m to the company, with the balance of $2m going in underwriting and commission charges. AOL as a public company had been born. Exciting as life had been up to to this point, it became much more so thereafter. In the early 1990s, neither the World Wide Web nor browsers had yet appeared; online services therefore carried only limited appeal. As the new Internet era dawned, levels of interest in online services increased accordingly. By 1992, Paul Allen, co-founder with Bill Gates at Microsoft, had built up a stake in AOL and was seeking to gain control. He was only thwarted by a last-minute ‘poison pill’ defence.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Gates also expressed an interest in the company to help add an improved online facility to the Windows service he was developing. Microsoft signified a willingness to pay at least $270m and possibly $400m for AOL, a substantial figure given AOL’s 250,000 subscribers and chequered financial history. The AOL board decided to maintain its independence, but only on a split decision. Given the difference in subscriber bases between AOL and its two main competitors, Prodigy and CompuServe, and the likelihood that it would also have to compete in due course with Microsoft, this was a brave decision. Whether or not it was a suicidal one was debatable at the time. From that point forward, AOL effectively opted for a ‘win or bust’ strategy entirely in keeping with the history of its original founder, Von Meister.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In 1993, a marketing strategy was developed which has been described as a carpet-bombing campaign. In essence it was a straightforward mailshot – but on a scale that had never been seen before, in which a staggering 250 million discs were sent out to customers, giving them a period of free access to the service. The campaign was an unqualified success, bringing in massive numbers of new subscribers and moving AOL to centre stage. Of the available online services, AOL was the most customer-focused. The surge in users created huge technical problems, but AOL worked hard to remove potential hurdles. The next stage was the arrival of Microsoft’s online service and the emergence of both the World Wide Web and the browser. The challenge from Microsoft was simple. If its online service could be bundled with Windows, and other services excluded, in all likelihood it would eventually dominate the market, pushing AOL to one side. The threat it faced from browsers and the Internet was not just that new service providers would appear, but also that the market would be segmented and a brutal price war break out.</span> </p>
