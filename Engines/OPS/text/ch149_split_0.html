<p><span class="style0">Given the overlap with Mac, Microsoft sought to protect itself by negotiating a licence for the Mac operating system. It achieved this by threatening to cease development work on important Mac applications. The licence to the visual characteristics of the Macintosh was signed in November 1985. Microsoft was not alone in working on a GUI, but it had the distinct advantage of being the author of MS-DOS and having the best understanding of the Mac operating system outside Apple.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Although the first release of Windows (version 1) which arrived in October 1985 was unwieldy and slow, it was still better than the GUIs produced by others, including IBM. The software needed to be improved, but more than this it required substantially more memory and processing power to sustain it. The experience of the Apple Mac and Windows Version 1 was to become prevalent in the industry. That is, early estimations of the need for memory and processing power had been formulated on the back of an entirely erroneous set of assumptions. The tasks for which a PC could be used was expanding rapidly, but more importantly it was becoming increasingly easier to use, as the software now being written enabled the user to concentrate on the task being undertaken rather than on the computer itself. This process ate up memory and processing power, and as Intel and its competitors brought out new processors in accordance with Moore’s law, software developers scrambled to make use of the additional resource. VisiCalc had shown how software could sell computers, and Windows took this a stage further by becoming inseparable from the computer. It was no longer IBM that represented the industry standard but Microsoft. IBM maintained high sales, but clone producers took market share and the pricing competition was intense. The margins, though, belonged to Microsoft.</span> </p>
