<h1 id="anchor_3709_0"><span class="style1">The calculator – accidental mass market product</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In many ways the calculator can be seen as the natural culmination of the efforts of the scientists of the previous century. Two great tasks of government – public finance and defence – relied upon mathematical calculation, whether it was the calculation of taxes under Napoleon, or code-breaking under Churchill. As a consequence, governments throughout the world had a powerful interest in funding and encouraging the development of the ability to compute. The science of ballistics during and after World War II took this need to new heights and the level of sophistication required increased in parallel. Huge, expensive mainframe computers were built and immediately the search began for improved versions. The use of computers spread from the government, military and academic sectors and began to play a role in private companies, just as adding machines had done 50–60 years before.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">With the advent of transistors, and then semiconductors, the way was paved for a reduction in the physical size of computers. DEC brought in the minicomputer to rival IBM’s dominance in mainframes. Semiconductor research became an industry in its own right. Grosch’s law had been undermined by the emergence of the minicomputer and was to be made obsolete by the development of the microprocessor. As scientific advances followed upon each other, a new law was to emerge which was the antithesis of Grosch’s law. The rate of progress embodied in these advances was neatly summarised as Moore’s law, which first saw the light of day in the anniversary edition of</span> <span class="style1">Electronics</span> <span class="style0">magazine in 1965. Roughly stated, this asserted that the complexity of computer chips would double roughly every year. As one of the founders of Intel, Gordon Moore himself helped to bring this to pass, but the latent demand for computing power was the decisive factor in making it happen.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The electronic calculator is an example of a technological advance that started out as pure science, and was then forced to find a commercial outlet which had not hitherto obviously existed. Before the calculator, the slide rule was the principal available tool for small-scale calculations. This was an aid, but using it remained laborious. The earliest electrical calculators were pieces of precision engineering requiring complex gear and transmission systems. The main manufacturers were based in developed economies – the USA, Germany, Italy and the UK – where the necessary skills and equipment existed. Japan had no real presence until the Kashio family sought to move its business into what they perceived as a new growth area. Hitherto their main product had been a metal ring which fitted over the finger and held a cigarette. This allowed the smoker to puff away at his cigarette while remaining free to smoke and work at the same time. The key selling point was that, given the high cost of tobacco, smokers could now smoke their cigarettes down to the butt without burning their fingers! Despite such improvements as plating the rings with chrome to enhance their appearance, demand for this curious product eventually disappeared.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In 1950 Toshio Kashio designed a solenoid-based electrical calculator, but abandoned this in favour of an electrical relay version that avoided the noise problems of existing electro-mechanical machines. After seven years of perseverance, his model was completed. It was approximately three feet square and weighed about the same as a sumo wrestler. The calculator was priced at a discount to its imported competitors, and as it became cheaper, and the Japanese economy started to grow rapidly, sales took off. Growth continued apace and the corporation broadened its product range to include scientific calculators. The company, Casio, became increasingly prosperous. Its future seemed rosy.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This idyllic situation was shattered in mid-1964 when Sharp introduced the first electronic calculator to Japan. Overnight, Casio’s relay calculators had become technologically redundant. Had the company stayed abreast of technological developments taking place in America, this would not have happened. However, as the chairman of the company subsequently admitted, success and the profits this generated had bred a degree of complacency, which manifested itself in thrice-weekly family fourballs at the local golf course, rather than attention to their own engineers’ warnings of the growing threat from the new electronics industry. Drastic retrenchment allowed the company to survive. Many of its competitors proved unable to react with such speed and disappeared. In 1967 Casio produced a desktop electronic calculator. This had now slimmed down in size from the weight of a sumo wrestler to that of a small child.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The product that Sharp brought to the market can also be traced back to skills developed during World War II by both the Allied and Axis powers. During the war an engineer named Tadashi Sasaki was employed by the aircraft manufacturer Kawanishi Kobe to work on antiradar devices. During the postwar period, this company merged to become Kobe Kogyo. It later became part of Fujitsu in the early 1960s. Sasaki was a key figure in the development of the Japanese semiconductor industry. He was a visitor to Bell Laboratories and corresponded with John Bardeen, co-inventor of the transistor. Sasaki understood immediately the significance of the transistor and instituted a research programme at Kobe Kogyo.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Kobe Kogyo was also a supplier of electronic components to Sharp, at that time a manufacturer of domestic appliances. At Sasaki’s instigation, Sharp sent a number of employees to retrain as part of an attempt to enter the calculator business. In 1964, when Kobe Kogyo had been absorbed into Fujitsu, Sasaki moved to a senior position at Sharp, where he could oversee its entry into the calculator industry and the production of the first transistorised calculator. Sasaki kept a close eye on developments in the US semiconductor industry, but was unable to break the consensus within Sharp that it was better to proceed with a programme of incremental improvement to existing circuits than to try and reduce all the required functions to a single chip. Sharp’s supplier of chips, Rockwell, refused Sasaki’s request to develop such a chip on the basis that it would divert valuable resources away from its existing profitable semiconductor business <span id="anchor_3723_155"></span>lines.<a href="ch150.html#anchor_4079_0">⁸⁷</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Sharp had been visited by Robert Noyce of Intel in 1968. Given Noyce’s background with Fairchild, Sasaki was keen to see if Intel could produce under contract the technology that Rockwell did not wish to pursue. The suggestion was made, but Rockwell, which had an exclusive contract, rejected the request from Sharp. Frustrated by his inability to promote this line of development within <span id="anchor_3725_64"></span>Sharp,<a href="ch150.html#anchor_4080_0">⁸⁸</a> Sasaki decided to provide financial assistance to a small Japanese company to whom he had provided technical input in the past. The president of this company, Business Computer (Busicom), was an alumnus of the same university department as Sasaki. Sasaki provided ¥40m (equivalent to roughly $120,000 at the time, or nearly $0.5m now) for Busicom to contract Intel to produce the chip that Sasaki had failed to promote within Sharp.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Desktop electrical calculators had been produced through the 1960s in America, but their cost meant that their use was limited to scientific and high-level business applications. The Mathetron, a programmable desktop electrical calculator produced by a division of the Barry Wright Corporation, was one of the first models in the United States. It sold for nearly $6,000 ($33,000) in 1964. The Hewlett-Packard 9100B, designed for scientists and engineers, appeared in 1968 at a price of $4,900 ($23,000) and the Sharp Compet 361R shortly afterwards. These machines were invaluable to the scientific and business communities in that they greatly aided computational tasks but avoided the need for access to computers. These machines, like the majority of the market, were targeted at particular subsets of customers, users whose day-to-day existence typically involved heavy computational tasks.</span> </p>
