<p><span class="style0">To address these threats, Steve Case sought first to alert the Department of Justice to the consequences of bundling, and then to build up AOL’s defences by funding content providers such as The Motley Fool and iGolf. AOL had tried to obtain a stake in Netscape during its VC funding round, but found itself shut out due to potential conflict of interest. Instead AOL purchased the BookLink browser and NaviSoft, a Web publishing and development tool producer. The strategy was relatively straightforward: whether you build it or buy it, do it now. This strategy was made possible by the strong performance of AOL’s share price, which provided it with a currency with which to make acquisitions. At the same time AOL started to build out its own network so as to reduce its dependence upon third parties that might potentially one day hold it to ransom. In addition, AOL sought to internationalise its service by signing an agreement with the German publishing company Bertelsmann. In such a frenetic atmosphere, it was inevitable that some deals would prove mistakes, but the danger of not doing deals was to risk suffering the fate of the more conservative CompuServe. The latter’s strategy consigned it to a future of pedestrian growth and life as a niche player in the industry.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The refusal of Netscape to accept AOL as an investor might well have proved a blessing in disguise. Although Netscape’s browser was the clear market leader, and would undoubtedly have benefited AOL, losing it did not hurt its growth dramatically. AOL was in a battle with Microsoft and its competing offering MSN, but the online service battle was of less significance to Microsoft than the browser war. The browser war threatened the core of Microsoft’s profitability, which was its Windows operating system. If Netscape’s browser could become the industry standard and the Internet was truly the future, then by implication Windows stood to lose its dominant position. Certainly this was the future that Netscape was trumpeting. Bill Gates viewed this as the most serious threat to his company.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">AOL was therefore in a position reminiscent of Rockefeller during the railroad wars. Indeed, the agreement AOL subsequently signed with Microsoft had a provision for payments to convert Netscape Navigator users to Windows Explorer. The two browser war protagonists both required an alliance with AOL to cement their positions. The difference was that Netscape believed AOL had no alternative, while Microsoft believed a deal was vital. In 1996, Case completed a series of deals which put AOL in a position from which it could become the dominant Internet force. First, in March, a deal was announced with Apple which put AOL on all Apple Macintoshes and also passed Apple’s eWorld online service to AOL. Shortly thereafter an alliance with Netscape was revealed whereby AOL would license Netscape Navigator and receive space on the Netscape Web. AOL also completed a deal with AT&amp;T in early March, but the denouement was to come with an entirely unexpected arrangement. Unlike Netscape, Microsoft had been assiduously courting AOL. Microsoft’s browser was free, while Netscape’s was not. And, unlike Netscape, Microsoft could bestow the ultimate prize for any ISP, which was an information folder packaged with Windows 95 software. Since AOL’s Netscape deal had no exclusivity clause, Case was free to sign the second deal with Microsoft – a deal the effect of which was to ensure the eclipse of Netscape as the dominant browser company.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">From this point on, the future for AOL, while not assured, was to follow a more conventional route. This path involved a greater focus on the company’s financial position and the changing competitive landscape. So far as the financial position was concerned, it was ironic that AOL, for all its new economy credentials, had been using the kind of accounting policies favoured by ‘old economy’ companies and fast-growing conglomerates, namely early recognition of revenues and deferred recognition of expenses. AOL sought to amortise the cost of the customers it acquired over an extended period. This had the benefit of boosting revenues during periods of rapid growth, but undermined them when growth began to slow. In regard to the competitive landscape, after some years of expanding rapidly through market growth against relatively moribund competitors, AOL was now faced with a rapid influx of new entrants. These entrants found financing increasingly easy as the stock market reacted to Internet companies with increasing favour. They typically priced their service packages at an aggressively low price in order to obtain rapid subscriber growth. A final problem for AOL was that a substantial proportion of AOL’s revenues still derived indirectly from the pornography industry, which had quickly realised the power of the new distribution medium and in particular the use that could be made of AOL’s private and unpoliced chat rooms.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">So despite its success in establishing a dominant market position, AOL was not without its challenges. Putting these factors together produced a company whose historic revenues had to be restated, whose future revenues were under threat and whose moral standards were in question. The problem facing AOL could be summarised as to somehow increase revenues, cut prices, reduce the customer churn rate and maintain growth, while at the same time distancing itself from the increasing reaction to revelations about the role of the Internet in paedophilia and pornography. The year 1996 therefore proved a difficult one, with little prospect of immediate improvement.</span> </p>
