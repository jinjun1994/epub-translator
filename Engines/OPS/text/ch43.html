<title>Competitors emerge - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<div style="width:100%;height:14.375000000000002px;"></div>
<h1 id="anchor_1242_0"><span class="style1">Competitors emerge</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The only competition of any note came from the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company, which had come to arrangements with Union Pacific in 1869 (and later also Central Pacific) in exchange for stock. Despite these contracts, A&amp;P was less than one twentieth the size of the Western Union – and apparently little threat to the industry giant. However, for an ardent speculator such as Jay Gould, nothing was that simple. Gould recognised the strategic importance of the telegraph and took an increasing interest in A&amp;P following his involvement with Union Pacific.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">With the assistance of Thomas Eckert – whose career aspirations had been disappointed by Vanderbilt’s appointee as president of Western Union, William Orton – Gould attempted to gain control of new technological developments by backing Thomas Edison, an increasingly prolific scientist and sometime Western Union employee. In the convoluted sequence of events that unfolded, there were the by-now-normal ingredients of double-dealing, intrigue, broken contracts and litigation. At root was an attempt by Gould to get control of the technology underpinning the rapid transmission of information. This battle, ironically, took place just before Alexander Graham Bell emerged with the technology that would eventually eclipse the whole telegraph system. Even the greatest speculators of the day completely underestimated the importance of the telephone, instead fighting a battle over a technology which was to soon prove largely redundant.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The sequence began with Edison resigning from Western Union in 1869 to strike out on his own as an inventor. In August 1870, Edison made significant improvements in the automatic telegraph. This system replaced the Morse methodology by using perforating machines to record messages. These were then fed into a transmitter, sent down the lines, received and printed automatically at the other end.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The development work was funded by a company, the Automatic Telegraph Company, set up in November 1870 for the purpose by George Harrington, a former secretary to the US Treasury. Edison soon exasperated his financiers by spending over $30,000 ($2.5m) developing the system, five times the original projection. After disagreements over the speed of development, Edison walked out, only to return two years later after spending the intervening period upgrading the stock ticker machine for a company controlled by Western Union. Edison then combined working directly for Western Union and upgrading the ‘automatic’ for his previous company.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The new, improved automatic was sufficiently successful to worry Western Union. As the telegraph lines ran parallel to the railroads, information transfer had become a vital part of a railroad’s commercial viability. They were thus an integral and expanding part of Western Union’s success. In 1873, during Edison’s tenure with Western Union, he developed the Quadruplex. This device allowed two streams of information to flow in both directions along the telegraphic cable and made a huge difference to the cost of laying telegraphic lines. Edison estimated the cost saving to Western Union would be of the order of $450,000 and demanded a better contract from William Orton, the company president. Orton believed Edison was effectively tied to Western Union with no alternatives, and therefore pitched his financial offer substantially below the package Edison requested.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Edison responded by falling into the arms of Jay Gould. This was engineered through the offices of General Thomas Eckert, the general superintendent of Western Union’s eastern division. Eckert had expected to become president of Western Union, but his ambitions had been thwarted by the Vanderbilt’s installation of Orton. With his path at Western Union barred, Eckert defected to head Gould’s company, the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company. Western Union was stung into immediate action by this betrayal. They tried to re-enter negotiations with Edison, but to no avail. In December 1874, the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company purchased the Automatic Telegraph Company, bringing with it the rights to the automatic. Since Edison had never entered into any formal agreements regarding the Quadruplex with Western Union, Gould now ostensibly had the potent mixture of the automatic and the Quadruplex. When combined with his telegraph network, it seemed that Gould could easily mount a serious challenge to Western Union’s supremacy in the information transfer business.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In 1875, Gould set about using A&amp;P as a vehicle to threaten Western Union’s dominance. Ever the mercenary, Edison fell out with Eckert and defected from the A&amp;P camp, but the battle continued against Western Union and its owners, the Vanderbilts. For three years, Gould conducted a price war against Western Union, including threats to expand the A&amp;P network, further encroaching on Western Union’s domain. This attack was bolstered by undermining the Vanderbilts’ other interests.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The death of Cornelius Vanderbilt in 1877, combined with the concerted attack on the Vanderbilts’ railroad interests, forced William Vanderbilt to bring the war to a conclusion. In 1878 Western Union bought A&amp;P. However, the success of this raid only served to whet Gould’s appetite. Within a year, and using effectively the same set of tactics, he launched another price war, this time through a company called American Union. The result was even more successful; on this occasion Gould emerged with 90,000 shares of Western Union and a seat on the board of directors. Extensive stock watering and an $80m recapitalisation accompanied the 1881 merger.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Gould’s attacks on Western Union resulted in his acquiring a position of influence within the company. It is not surprising, then, that Western Union soon found itself under attack from other rivals. The principal attacker was the Baltimore and Ohio Telegraph Company, which pressed a price war until it too was eventually acquired by Western Union in 1887. Even in 1880 Western Union accounted for 80% of America’s telegraph traffic, but with the absorption of B&amp;O, Western Union effectively was the telegraph industry. The boardroom reflected the company’s power and influence, with nominee directors of Gould and Vanderbilt, representatives from Union Pacific and Central Pacific, Thomas Eckert and, last but not least, the financier J. P. Morgan. Western Union dominated its industry in a way that no railroad had been able to do. It was against arguably the most powerful corporation in America that the telephone was to emerge to do battle.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Ultimately Western Union’s success depended upon two things: the outcome of a series of lawsuits regarding the ownership of the patents on improvements to the telegraph, and a dominant position in the physical ownership of the network. These two aspects were linked, in the sense that without the Western Union patents, ownership of the cables was of little value. There was also some luck. Western Union’s industry dominance had made it careless about protecting its rights, and it was only Edison’s deteriorating relationship with the management of Gould’s company that enabled it to maintain its stranglehold. The fallout allowed Orton to reach an agreement with Edison, resulting in all suits being dropped and Edison receiving a series of payments.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">There were clear lessons in the story of the Quadruplex. First, it was vital to establish clear legal title on inventions. Second, that legal title had to be protected, not used as collateral to fund other experiments or business ventures. Learning these lessons proved an expensive exercise. Fatally for Western Union, the company did not see the technology shift that would make its patents obsolete. At the time, the potential challenge from the telephone must have seemed remote to a company which had achieved a dominant position in its own new form of information transfer. Not only did it dominate its industry, it also had on its books the most eminent and successful scientists of the age. Western Union’s internal records show that it saw the telephone as only a peripheral threat. It also assumed that should such a threat emerge, the company’s scientific resources and its financial strength would give it the strength to resist. Since the company was in perhaps its most prosperous phase, with strong revenue and profits growth, such a view was not unreasonable. But as history was to prove, it was completely misplaced.</span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">Western Union</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Western Union’s dominance of the telegraph market is readily apparent from its financial statements. In the early years of the 1860s, operating margins rested in the 35–40% range, while sales grew at an average annual compound rate of 10%. Sales were sensitive to underlying economic conditions, though demand was relatively inelastic. Growth slowed rather than declined significantly when times were tough. During the economic turn-down and stock market crash in the later 1860s, Jay Cooke and many financial companies – as well as a number of railroads, including Northern Pacific – went under. Western Union remained profitable at both an operating and net income level. Net profits fell by around 10%.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The strongest period of growth in profitability for Western Union was seen as the US economy emerged from the problems of the early 1870s and telegraph traffic soared. The irony was that the increased traffic came just at the time that a competitor was being formed which would eventually overtake and dwarf the company’s business. Margins had started to fall even before the emergence of the telephone. Sales increases required lower prices and cost pressures proved difficult to control. Unit volume growth also slowed, and as a consequence the net income of the company stopped growing in any meaningful manner. Industrial unrest at the company also played a part. With demands for higher compensation intensifying in a period when profitability was declining, it is not surprising that management resisted these demands strongly.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style1">The balance sheet of the company had been subjected to the malign influence of Jay Gould. The impact of new stock issuance and the subsequent recapitalisation in 1881 can clearly be seen in the decline in return on equity and return on assets over the period. The balance sheet before the recapitalisation showed little debt and there was no real business need for new equity to be issued. If earnings per share had been one of the metrics of the time, the impact of share issuance would have been much more obvious. A rough estimate suggests that earnings per share barely increased at all in the 50 years to the mid-1860s. Having said this, the main criterion for most investors was the dividend paid – and, aside from a drop during the depression of 1873, investors were rewarded with a sharply rising dividend stream. This continued until the mid-1880s, when the telephone’s inroads into the telegraph’s domination of high-speed communication became increasingly clear. The telegraph effectively became a niche player rather than the mainstream carrier. This did not mean that the business suddenly became unprofitable. Even during the rapid growth in the telephone market, Western Union continued to earn a reasonable return on its assets. The problem was that the cost of adding to capacity could not be justified by the incremental increase in earnings. The business was experiencing falling profitability but had little potential to restore growth. From the mid-1880s onwards, the investor could only invest on the basis of future dividend flow, which in turn was constrained by earnings.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The performance of the shares reflects this outcome, though it should be noted that Western Union’s assets were potentially of value to the Bell Companies, which had the ability to obtain greater use of its fixed assets by combining the two companies. In 1910, Bell did take control of Western Union, but was forced to divest itself because of the hostile reaction of competitors and government to the potential monopoly threat. In 20 years, therefore, Western Union declined from being the dominant player in the industry, with unrivalled scientific and financial resources, to an asset-play takeover candidate. This did not happen overnight, but the decline was inexorable and inevitable as soon as the case against the Bell patent was lost. The technological shift was so profound that there was little Western Union could do to reverse the process. A more clearly defined case of a technological redundancy would be hard to find. For investors, the share price decline initiated by the advent of the telephone was the start of an enduring and unrewarding trend.</span> </p>
