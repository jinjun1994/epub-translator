<p><span class="style0">With its additional capital, Amazon was in a position to ramp up its activities, but it was not long before an IPO was being planned. By early 1997 proposals were being solicited from leading investment banks. On 15 May 1997 10% of the company was sold at a price of $18 per share, raising just over $50m for the company. Circumstances were not demonstrably propitious. This was a company that had neither made a profit nor was projecting one in the immediate future. It was also facing a counter-attack from an established, traditional company – Barnes &amp; Noble – which had begun to embrace the new technology and was also pursuing Amazon through the courts. That the IPO went smoothly despite these conditions says much for the evangelical abilities of Bezos. Post-IPO Amazon has typically raised further capital through the debt markets in order to fund its expansion. This expansion has been both geographic, with properties purchased in both Germany and the UK, and by segment – with an ever increasing range of products being sold through the Amazon website.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Reflecting on the period since 2001 and the previous edition of this book highlights a small number of key elements in shaping the evolution of the company. It is hard to know whether Jeff Bezos is a genius or not, but he certainly had an extraordinary clarity over the environment that was unfolding. This is not unusual in new enterprises with dominant figures at their helm. What is unusual is that his conception was correct, he would not be deflected and he had the capital to pursue it. The economic principle of minimising inventory to create a competitive advantage on the cost curve underlies everything that Amazon has done since its early days as a bookselling operation. With the benefit of hindsight it all seems obvious, but at the time the prevailing wisdom was different. Consider the now infamous view expressed by George Colony, president of Forrester Research, who dubbed the firm “Amazon.toast” once Barnes &amp; Noble decided to enter the online bookselling market. He followed up with a note arguing that online brands were fleeting, customer information was ubiquitous, technology in this field was not proprietary and fulfillment could be easily replicated. To be fair, all of these statements were plausible and potentially true. Amazon just proved to them all to be unambiguously wrong.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Perhaps the mistake Amazon’s critics made was to confuse a simple idea about the nature of the Internet with the practical difficulty of implementation. The front end of Amazon’s website is only the tip of the iceberg, as many potential competitors have found out to their cost. Behind it sits a ruthless culture focused on continual cost reduction, increased efficiency and product expansion. Arguably the genius of Amazon is as much the commercial execution over an extended period as it is the initial concept.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">If one were to take an economist’s view, Amazon’s role in life is to create ‘perfectly competitive’ markets where they currently do not exist. For consumers this is the holy grail, but for wholesalers or suppliers to Amazon it is a less-enticing prospect. Greater volumes can be achieved on Amazon, but margins effectively become transparent and the ability to profit from price discrimination between groups of consumers is largely eliminated. Amazon’s ability to achieve its dominance in Internet retailing required scale above all else. Consumers had to be convinced that by visiting Amazon they could expect safe, reliable, low-cost delivery of the products they sought. That underpinned Amazon’s claim to be the “earth’s largest bookstore” early in its corporate history. At the time there were many arguments, some of them legal (e.g. Barnes &amp; Noble’s lawsuit – see figure 10.21) about the veracity of the statement.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Just as importantly, achieving the scale necessary to make the business model work required repeated postponement of profits. Free or subsidised shipping, rapid expansion of fulfillment centres, focus on logistics and data management and analysis; all of these were milestones on the route to scale. If sufficient scale had not been reached, the whole model could have fallen in on itself. Indeed, this was the focus of a series of sellside reports from Lehman Brothers analyst Ravi Suria in 2000. In the wake of the continued collapse of the TMT bubble, his bearish report found a receptive audience – another example of investors’ inability to spot long-term winners. What the report missed was that Amazon had raised sufficient capital to carry it through to a point where the intrinsically strong cash flow characteristics of the business would become apparent. Put simply, when customer revenues come in before payments are made to suppliers and fixed costs are stable, in a high-growth, rapid turnover business the potential for creating prodigious cash flow should not be underestimated.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Having demonstrated the efficacy of its business model with books, Amazon began an inexorable drive to expand its product range, beginning with DVDs. DVDs were the first simple and logical extension, and as the distribution infrastructure developed and expanded, the addition of more and more product lines became feasible. The game that was replayed (and won) time after time was persuading suppliers to put their products on the Amazon platform. The model has continued to evolve. Third-party sellers have become an ever more important element of Amazon’s revenue. This again reflects the need to continue providing consumers with the widest choice and the lowest prices. It is highly detrimental to the margins of competitors, but highly beneficial to consumers.</span> </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span class="style3">Amazon</span> </h2>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Amazon was founded by an entrepreneurial individual who recognised the potential power of a new distribution medium. Following this recognition, a prototype was created with the assistance of external funding and translated into a working model. The company experienced rapid growth in top-line revenues in its early years and also burned capital as the infrastructure necessary to sustain future growth was put in place. Amazon got through cash at a rapid rate and faced a constant battle to retain the confidence of capital markets (and hence the future supply of capital) at a time when its balance sheet was deteriorating rapidly. This placed it firmly in the tradition of previous technology pioneers that needed at all costs to maintain a convincing evangelist stance in order to survive. Bezos and his colleagues produced a steady stream of bullish statements on future prospects for the Internet and e-commerce.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">The big question for Amazon shareholders at the time the first edition of this book appeared in 2001, was whether the company could translate continued growth in gross revenues into a positive profits stream. Gross revenues were compounding nicely, but the expansion had largely been funded through debt or debt-related instruments. The company was approaching a cash flow crunch as its balance sheet was stretched. If holders of its debt had demanded greater security at that point, it could have been forced to slash its variable costs, including the marketing spend it needed to sustain its future growth. Operational losses at that point exceeded $0.5bn, while shareholder equity was less than half that figure. In the aftermath of the stock market crash, shareholders were fearful of having their already much reduced equity diluted further at the behest of the debtholders.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">As it turned out, while Amazon was unable to deliver meaningful profits, it did continue to grow its revenues at a rapid rate and this was sufficient to maintain confidence. The combination of positive cash flow and balance sheet debt allowed it to avoid further dilutive equity issuance, other than in the form of staff compensation. The share price fell by more than 90% from the peak, but the company survived and the shareholders avoided dilution. Despite a fragile balance sheet the management successfully managed to maintain the confidence of its suppliers and lenders against a backdrop of criticism in financial markets and the media.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style1">Since the lows of 2001 the company has continued its relentless top-line growth, with sales revenues compounding at around 25% per annum. The business has both broadened and deepened with the addition of cloud services and ever-improving content. The efficiency of its inventory and distribution systems has produced an economy-wide revolution in online retailing. By 2015 annual sales, remarkably, passed $100bn for the first time. Profitability has lagged, however, and operating margins remain low. The fact that the company’s valuation has remained so persistently high is a testament to the focus of investors on the company’s relentless pursuit of scale. By its nature Amazon’s online offering means that the company has only a limited ability to raise pricing if it is to maintain the ‘lowest-price’ offering. Any expansion of profitability will therefore have to come from added services such as new content, product extension and cloud services to third parties. Notwithstanding the growth in top-line revenues, there is now a danger that investors have become too enthusiastic about Amazon’s profit potential, just as they were overly pessimistic during the TMT collapse.</span> </p>
