<title>A new Industrial Revolution… - Engines That Move Markets</title>

<h1 id="anchor_4623_0"><span class="style1">A new Industrial Revolution…</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Internet and the World Wide Web have together created a new technology that clearly mirrors many of the characteristics of previous advances. Like the railroads, it has generated significant improvements in carrying capacity, engines and signalling. Like the telephone, it has become a new revolutionary method of linking different parties. Just as the railroads took traffic from other means of transport to increase usage, so too the Internet has replaced and expanded on the back of other forms of communication. Like the telephone it has achieved extremely high penetration rates. Access to the Internet is now ubiquitous in both fixed-line and mobile communications.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The comparisons with the railroad and the telephone are not entirely exact, however. In both those cases the owners of the networks had control over access. The financial benefits of control over a monopolistic industry eventually produced an antitrust backlash, resulting in the breakup of Standard Oil and the Bell Companies. This history has contributed to the regulation of modern telecoms and the application of the principle of ‘net neutrality’. In general, telecom operators are allowed to charge for access to their network but typically within a framework of regulated returns based on invested capital, with some form of pricing discipline created by allowing others access to the network. Loosely defined, net neutrality is designed to prevent discriminatory charging and service levels between different forms of traffic on the Internet. What this means in practice is that providers of digital content effectively have access to a free distribution channel. This in turn places a premium value on content ownership. Whether this survives indefinitely is another question.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The antitrust parallels with Standard Oil and the Bell Companies are not irrelevant when appraising where the dominant companies in the new online world now stand. Social media and search are two business models the size and scale of which suggest that they are potential natural monopolies. Since history records that monopolies often end up abusing the power conferred on them by their market position, at some point they become the target of regulatory action. It is difficult to believe that Amazon, Google and Facebook, the new global titans of our age, will be the exceptions that prove the rule. Nevertheless, the history of the Internet as a new industrial force also reminds us that the development of a new technology rarely follows a pre-ordained script.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The initial killer application on the Internet was electronic mail. While email remains important, the reach of the Internet has expanded well beyond this. Various business segments have been defined: there is the so-called business-to-consumer (B2C) market, the business-to-business (B2B) market and also – something that AOL saw very early – a powerful mechanism for the delivery of multimedia content. The commercialisation of the Internet has evolved in phases. Initially it revolved around completing the creation of a global interconnected network. It migrated to the early business models of advertising and B2C-based companies. These models are still evident in more recent business creation, rippling out through a range of different industries and product types. The impact on incumbent companies will be no less profound than those which have already been experienced by, for example, the newsprint industry or consumer electronics retailers.</span> </p>
