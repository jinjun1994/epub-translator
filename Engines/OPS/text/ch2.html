<p><span class="style0">Entering into a venture such as researching and writing this book while in full-time employment was not something that I did lightly. I took the decision at the height of the Internet bubble of 1999–2000. The driving force behind it was the frustration I felt in respect of what was happening in global stock markets at the time and the dangers this was likely to present for investors. In all likelihood the frustration I felt with stock market gyrations was soon matched by that of my family as I disappeared off to work on ‘the book’. For nearly 18 months I was posted missing and without doubt I owe a large debt of gratitude to my wife for putting up with me for this period. Nearly 20 years later, for this and many other reasons, the debt of gratitude has only grown.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The book itself could not have been written without the assistance of an individual with an ability to unearth information that is simply unrivalled. Murray Scott gave up much of his spare time to help me gather the historic financial information and put it in a useable form. It is difficult to give a flavour of just how much information had to be collected – suffice to say that it reached the ceiling of the room in which it was stored. What Murray was able to find was incredible and testament to his tenacity in chasing down information. In this he was aided by an outside world of librarians and archivists who typically provided enthusiastic support in the search for lost or forgotten documents. You are a wonderful group of people – thank you.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">I would also to thank those who looked at various manuscripts, including Gordon Milne and in particular Jonathan Davis, who has edited, corrected and improved many versions of the text, including this second updated edition. The pair of us have since collaborated on a second book,</span> <span class="style1">Templeton’s Way With Money</span><span class="style0">, and a third is now in preparation. The fact that we are still working together after all this effort is a wondrous thing and a testament to the pleasures of collaboration.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks finally to Myles Hunt and Christopher Parker of Harriman House who, together with other unheralded colleagues, have shepherded this new edition into print with consummate patience and skill.</span> </p>
