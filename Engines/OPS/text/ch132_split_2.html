<p><span class="style0">However, the stakes were dramatically raised in the early 1960s when IBM took the ambitious but necessary step of unifying its product line. Up to that point, compatibility between different models of IBM computer had been limited. The focus was on the production of a single computer of a certain size rather than as one element in a broad product range. As a consequence, customers who wished to upgrade their computer faced the prospect of substantial reprogramming and retraining, which some saw as the equivalent of switching suppliers. Not only was this risky in terms of customer retention, but it also added huge extra cost to IBM in terms of the resources which had to be devoted across the whole range of its computers. After much debate, IBM resolved to make its entire range compatible. This was a massive undertaking, largely spurred by the success of the Honeywell 200 against IBM’s prime model. In 1964 a massive press campaign was launched simultaneously across the major cities of America announcing the launch of the System 360.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The System 360 was a resounding success, reinforcing IBM’s dominant market position. Indeed, so successful were the results of the compatibility program that IBM became the subject of repeated investigation by regulators looking for evidence of market abuses, monopoly behaviour and violation of antitrust legislation. The company was ultimately successful in its defences against most charges, but the onslaught undoubtedly had an impact on the corporate psyche. IBM became a corporation where the legal implications of any of its actions had to be carefully evaluated, not an ideal situation in a dynamic and growing industry and one which was likely to slow down an already huge corporation.</span> </p>
