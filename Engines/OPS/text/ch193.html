<h1 id="anchor_5037_0"><span class="style1">The Internet and the technology cycle</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Anyone who followed the saga of the Internet described in chapter 10 will recognise many of its characteristics in the technology cycle. Stage 1 grew quite slowly out of the embers of the personal computer funding boom, and was slightly unusual in that the basic research and much of the subsequent infrastructure funding was provided by the government. This set the scene for slow but accelerating incremental improvements in Internet connectivity and access. The public funding of large-scale networking created ‘end user’ demand in the academic communities. A series of technical problems had to be solved before the potential had any possibility of becoming commercial reality. But as connectivity and access spread, new private sector entrants were able to look for profits from the opportunities that the Internet provided. Many were initially drawn towards developing software, where the cost of entry was significantly lower. An extended period of feasibility and prototyping followed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Along the way a number of individuals and groups created solutions with commercial potential. The more far-sighted venture capitalists placed small sums with a number of these embryonic companies. Success did not come overnight – and many failures occurred along the way – but eventually the various pieces of the jigsaw came together to produce an Internet that was fit for commercial exploitation on a global scale. Rapid traffic and user growth followed. Once this became apparent to the public markets, unprecedented levels of venture capital funding and an IPO boom followed, made possible by a low-interest-rate regime and the willing suspension of disbelief by investors, based upon the promise of ‘sure’ returns in the short term. As we now know, this second stage ended abruptly in early 2000 as the interest-rate regime shifted upwards and reality began to intrude.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The duration and magnitude of stage 2 was supported by the benign economic environment that surrounded it. What is unusual about the TMT/Internet bubble, compared to many historical precedents, was that for many companies it was possible to raise funds without going through the early stages in the standard technology cycle. At the peak, companies did not have to demonstrate prototypes, viability or deployment to an unquestioning outside world. They did not have to achieve profitability or a robust cash flow position. In many cases, they did not even have to forecast the achievement of such a position within a meaningful time frame. This put them in a position where the ‘cash crunches’ that periodically occur as a technology moves through the various stages of the cycle were postponed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the absence of traditonal cash-crunch tests it became easier for valuation metrics to migrate away from their historic parameters, which they did with a vengeance, as described in chapter 10. In normal periods investors typically require to see at least the promise of a dividend stream from the majority of their investments. The ability to return cash has always been seen as an important measure of a company’s health. Even before the Internet bubble, however, this had started to change, largely for tax reasons. Share buybacks became more popular with both investors and corporations, which increasingly looked to replace dividends as the favoured form of distribution to shareholders. Changes to corporate incentive schemes, and in particularly the widespread adoption of share options as management incentives, further encouraged this change.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Nevertheless the Internet bubble was notable for taking the trend away from dividends and cash flow as a measure of corporate performance to new extremes. If one monitors published recommendations on securities during periods of technological change one can often observe a shifting of valuation parameters over time. As valuations become impossible to sustain against one benchmark, analysts move on to another more ‘acceptable’ benchmark. This reflects their natural bias towards optimism, based on the empirical fact that in the long run equity markets provide the strongest returns of any asset class. The Internet bubble was a textbook example of this process at work.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">11.3 – Bubble valuation anatomy: from fundamentals to concepts</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">What this migration in valuation techniques actually demonstrated was the ever-escalating risk of investing in companies whose prospects of generating cash flow and profits were receding into the future. The further one goes down this path, the closer in form investing becomes to gambling. Just as with gambling, the only person consistently to win from this game is the ‘house’ – in this case represented by the investment banks that provided a seemingly inexhaustible supply of new issues to satisfy investor demand and the brokers who earned fees by pushing those stocks on to their clients. Those who saw the emerging Internet bubble as a chance to make some easy money had to learn this timeless investment lesson for themselves.</span> </p>
