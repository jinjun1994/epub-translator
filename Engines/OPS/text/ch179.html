<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Investors played only a small part in the development and testing of the research and build out of the Internet. Nor were they asked to fund the development of the crucial infrastructure of the World Wide Web. This reflected the fact that almost the entire physical system was already in place, thanks to the earlier funding by government and the existence of an established telecommunications network. Funding the companies that queued up to take advantage of the Internet in its early stages was not therefore particularly capital-intensive. Cisco had at least rudimentary products in place before the founders had left their place of employment. Mosaic had much of its development work completed at university before Jim Clark raised the funds to pull out Andreessen and create Netscape. Yahoo was the product of postgraduate students using their time on campus to pursue their own interests before realising that there was commercial potential in their efforts. All these companies were vital early cogs in the development of the Internet as a commercial venture.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This does not in any way decry the achievements of these early pioneers – they all had to raise funds, work long hours and make personal sacrifices to create a business – but they had at least a rudimentary product at the point at which they were raising capital, and the amounts of capital they sought to raise were relatively small. The main company that differed in this respect was Amazon. Jeff Bezos from the beginning saw the potential of the Internet and set out to build a company that had the ability to take advantage of it. His business was self-funded in the early stages. External capital was only sought when he had run out of personal funds. By the time external capital was required the Internet bubble had begun to be inflated by the success of Netscape and others and he was able to raise funds without great difficulty.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The same optimistic environment that assisted Amazon fed on the early success of the company and continued to propel the share prices of other listed Internet-related companies. This created growing appetite for new securities that could potentially follow the same path. Because initial capital funding costs were relatively low, new companies were formed at a prolific rate. Wall Street embraced this lucrative money-making opportunity with enthusiasm and there emerged a seemingly endless supply of IPOs to meet demand from investors.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">These IPOs followed the time-tested route of building a book of potential institutional investors and placing only a limited amount of stock with the general public. The aim was to ensure aftermarket demand, such that the share prices would immediately rise and the demand for IPOs would be sustained and fuelled by the instant profits. A lucrative chain of events had been set in motion, where everyone gained so long as share prices rose. Venture capitalists and owners gained as their investments were monetised at IPO. Investment bankers and brokers gained in three distinct ways: directly from the fees associated with the IPO process, indirectly from the power to place stock to hungry clients, and indefinitely from an ongoing corporate banking relationship with the companies in question. Institutional investors gained if they were given stock in an IPO, since they obtained both stock and the knowledge of the level of over-subscription, allowing them to measure the scope for an instant profit.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Members of the public also stood to gain directly from the run of IPOs if they were fortunate enough to obtain stock – or as long as the share price continued to rise after listing. They might also have gained indirectly if they held mutual funds which took stock in IPOs or placings. A number of institutions were unable to resist the temptation to ‘goose’ the performance of their funds by over-weighting their portfolios with stocks obtained in an IPO, thereby furthering the track record and attracting more assets.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The presence of collective funds distinguishes the period from that of the very early technology booms, but only at the margin. In an easy-money environment, stock market gains readily attracted additional capital. The specialist press which had grown with the new medium performed its usual evangelist role, which spread to the mainstream press to some degree, although the latter remained relatively balanced in its assessment of the new developments. As in previous booms, the mainstream press both commented on the potential of the new technology and questioned the validity of the expanding valuations. As the excesses increased, satirical cartoons lampooned what was happening, just as they had in times past. Moreover, the valuations, many of which were as patently absurd as those of the Japanese asset bubble of the 1980s, prompted the publication of a number of books spelling out just how detached from reality they had become.</span> </p>
