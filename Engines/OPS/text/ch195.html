<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Contrary to the experience of earlier bubbles, the Internet itself has not produced meaningful amounts of excess capacity. Because of its very different history, having been financed largely out of the US public purse for so many years, it did not inspire a string of speculative ventures raising capital and laying lines in the hope of future returns, as was seen in the railway age. In that respect, the early stages of the Internet had much more in common with the early years of the telephone, when the Bell Companies retained their monopoly and had no need to lay excess lines to squeeze out competitors and forestall new entrants. The capital raised for Internet businesses effectively gave a swathe of new entrants sufficient funding to go on paying their running costs for many years, well beyond the normal time horizon at which innovators historically faced cash flow shortages. It produced instead a wild competitive race to achieve first-mover advantage, a trend which effectively transformed capital into current consumption rather than long-term sources of growth. Many of these ventures proved to have short lifespans.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">It was a different, but related, story in telecommunications, where massive amounts of capital flowed into building both fibre optic and wireless networks to support the expected growth of a ‘connected world’, a phenomenon that the Internet was rightly expected to help materialise. Much of the capital in this case was diverted into the hands of governments in the form of wireless licence auction proceeds. An auction of third generation (3g) mobile phone licences in the UK and Europe resulted in $150bn being paid to various European governments in auction proceeds, simply for the right to operate. The same amount again was raised to build the 3g infrastructure before the licences could be used and any revenue earned. Total global capital expenditure for the telecoms sector in 2000 alone was $243bn, a figure two and a half times greater than that invested five years previously. Within this figure the largest elements were Internet-related, either for broadband access, optical networking or wireless infrastructure.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">You could argue that, far from empowering a ‘new’ economy, what followed was a classic Keynesian make-work project, paying people to dig useless holes in the ground. Many of the telecom companies whose shares came to the public markets in the form of IPOs did little for productivity or product innovation. It took years for the substantial communications infrastructure put in place to be fully utilised and for many companies it never produced a meaningful rate of return. That is one reason why a number of prominent ventures that commanded huge market valuations for a while, such as Global Crossing, eventually went bust.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">How does this level of fundraising and capital expenditure compare with other examples in our historical survey? In today’s money the railway industry in its peak year raised roughly $250bn in authorised capital (although only a proportion was actually spent on infrastructure). The telecoms investment spend was therefore similar in magnitude. Or, looking at it another way, the $250bn invested in one year was roughly equivalent to the GDP of Russia! Was this huge investment in the development of the Internet and commuications infrastructure wisely spent? How long would it take to generate sufficient revenues to justify the investment? When would it feed through into a positive increment to economic growth? These were the questions that should have been posed at the time.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Over a decade and a half later the answers are painfully and predictably clear. For the many investors drawn to the telecoms sector by the promise of returns from the brave new interconnected world, the outcome in aggregate has been dismal. Shares in the sector fell nearly 60% from their peak, and although there has been a long and slow recovery since, they remained 40% lower in 2017 than they were then. It is true that profits have declined as the overspend washed its way through the system and competition became more intense, but the main cause was inflated expectations rather than poor profits growth. As in previous periods, the valuations that prevailed during the mania phase were simply detached from reality.</span> </p>
