<h1 id="anchor_1642_0"><span class="style1">Thomas Edison enters the field</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Although the development of electric light does not begin or end with Thomas Edison, he is undoubtedly the central figure in the story and one of the technological giants of the 19th century. He was a prolific inventor, with more than 1,000 patents to his name. Most of the leading financiers of the day, including Gould, Morgan and Rothschild, were involved in ventures of his in some shape or form. Many of these were commercial failures, but others were not. His lighting company eventually was to become General Electric, while many electric utilities in the USA began by franchising his technology, and still bear his name today.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The rave reviews for arc lighting, together with the associated fields of electric motors, may have stimulated Edison to devote his energies to finding a practical electric light source. He set himself the target of producing an incandescent lamp that could overcome the intensity and cost problems associated with arc lighting. Edison was aware of the published work of Joseph Swan and the advances that had taken place in incandescent lighting. He was also aware of the attention arc lighting had been attracting, although his fascination with electricity did not extend to a belief in the commercial viability of arc lighting technology. When Edison visited what was then the most advanced electric arc lighting system in the USA, at a copper and brass manufacturing centre in Ansonia, Connecticut, he bluntly told his host: “I don’t think you are on the right <span id="anchor_1646_142"></span>track.”<a href="ch68.html#anchor_1884_0">³²</a></span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Fortunately, Edison was more interested in creation than in criticism. He returned home to his New Jersey research laboratory, Menlo Park, and focused on proving his point. Five days later, he wired William Wallace, the owner of the plant in Ansonia, for an electrical generator, with the message: “Hurry up the machine. I have struck a <span id="anchor_1648_57"></span>bonanza.”<a href="ch68.html#anchor_1885_0">³³</a> Edison subsequently filed a patent ‘To Subdivide the Electric Light’, and followed this with other filings to help with the vacuum and other practical issues for the lamp. In his own inimitable fashion, Edison publicised his findings with extravagant claims that the popular press was only too happy to repeat.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Very little Edison said to the press was un-newsworthy. In his interview with a</span> <span class="style1">New York Sun</span> <span class="style0">reporter, he effectively predicted the end of gas lighting and its replacement with electric lighting, and set out how it might be done in lower Manhattan. During his interview, he not only implied that the theoretical issues had all been resolved, but also that the new invention was ready for practical demonstration and introduction. In reality, Edison would have known that extensive developmental work was still necessary. It is likely that he was simply proselytising based on his earlier successes in transforming theoretical breakthroughs into commercial reality. It is also likely that his difficulties in raising funding for these breakthroughs convinced him of the need to give out only positive information. Whatever his motivation, it had the desired effect. The flow of capital was maintained.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style2">Source:</span> <span class="style1">New York Herald</span><span class="style0">, 12 October 1878.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The response to Edison’s announcements was not uniformly positive. Many people, no doubt recalling the early claims for arc lighting and the subsequent resilience of the gas lighting industry, may have viewed Edison as just another challenger who was destined to fall by the wayside. The main problems were the technical hurdles that remained to be overcome. Perhaps as important, though, was the difficulty of competing against an industry – gas lighting – that had sunk large amounts of capital into its own technology and was bound to react by improving service and reducing costs. After all, this had been sufficient to see off the threat from arc lighting and there was nothing to suggest that incandescent lighting would be any different. The prevailing sentiment was one of confidence in the future of the gas industry. According to the financial press, “smart money” would use only share price weakness to accumulate positions.</span> </p>
