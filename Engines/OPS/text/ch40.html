<h1 id="anchor_1174_0"><span class="style1">Origins of the telegraph</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Many wars have been won through intelligence and the speed with which it is communicated to the central command. Historic methods of signalling ranged from hilltop fires to semaphore, from relays of riders transporting written messages to the use of carrier pigeons. Advance notice of events was also crucial to the financial sector, and businessmen stood to make or lose fortunes based on advance knowledge of the eventual outcome of armed conflicts. Little wonder, then, that these two groups, the military and the business community, were at the forefront of the development of rapid communications.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In Britain, as systems to shift passengers and freight evolved during the 18th and 19th centuries, these were typically quickly augmented to include the carriage of letters and communication. For centuries before the Industrial Revolution, passenger transport had relied heavily on horses and ships. Similarly, from the late 17th century to the 1830s, Britain’s postal service was a horse-drawn coach system operating along the main highways. Over the years the service was continually upgraded with better roads and coach designs, until journeys were recorded at the princely average speed of 12 miles per hour.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">By 1839 the Post Office was handling 76m letters per year at an average cost (to them) of 2.5 pence ($8.22). However, the public was charged up to four times this amount, as there existed no competitive mechanism to force prices down. Ultimately, the system itself was limited by the physical endurance of the horse. With the advent of the railway, the potential gains in speed and efficiency ensured that the coach and horses would soon be left far behind. The gains in speed ensured that the railway owners would quickly win the majority of the Post Office’s mail business. The relatively modest £1,313 in revenue ($1m) they received from the Post Office in 1837–38 had grown to over £80,000 ($58m) ten years later and to nearly £200,000 ($135m) five years after that.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The railways not only had the advantage of speed – they had size and thus capacity. Other efficiencies included carriages that were built to allow for mail sorting in the railway carriage itself while it was in motion. For all the rapid gains in revenue, the mail service represented a lucrative extra rather than a key revenue stream for the railways. For most British rail companies, the earnings from the postal service rarely exceeded 3–4% of net income. However, for the horse-drawn operators, the damage caused by their new competitor was fatal.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The use of new information systems to make the railways safer and more efficient was to play a more important part. In the early years, railway signalling had been undertaken by employees using flags during the day and lamps in darkness. Gradually, this changed to a series of fixed manual signals, augmented by a small lighthouse with a powerful parabolic light known as a ‘signal box’. Eventually the signal box would see the addition of a new technological advance, the telegraph.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The origins of the telegraph lay in Europe. In the late 1790s the French military developed the ‘optical telegraph’, based on semaphore, and this was adapted by the British Admiralty for sending messages from London to Portsmouth. As electrical transmission developed, semaphore signalling was replaced with a rudimentary form of telegraph. It did not happen immediately, however. The Admiralty turned down an electrical telegraph in 1816 on the basis that, with war concluded, there was no need to incur the additional cost of upgrading a satisfactory working system. This early version involved a dial with 25 magnetic needles which, when turned by electrical impulse, pointed to letters in the alphabet.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">As in Britain, the traditional method of land-borne mail delivery in the United States was based on the horse. In Britain there were the mail coaches, in America there was the stagecoach and the pony express. As steam-powered transportation developed through steamships and the railroads, so the use of horses for information-carrying diminished. As the railroads developed, so did the telegraph distribution network. In America though, unlike Britain, the system was to remain in private hands – albeit after initial, if somewhat hesitant, support from government.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The telegraph was resuscitated by the needs of the railroads, and its practical application was significantly improved by the work of Samuel Morse, a young American inventor. In 1837, Samuel Morse invented the first practical telegraph in America and in 1838 he applied for a patent following work he conducted with Alfred Vail. Eventually, the railroads would come to see the potential for the electric telegraph to monitor and control traffic. Morse also devised a telegraphic code consisting of dots and dashes – shorter and longer electrical impulses sent down the wire. The ‘Morse code’ system was important not just because it represented a simplified system, but because widescale adoption of the telegraph demanded the use of a single signalling system.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">While studying at Yale University, Morse had met Benjamin Silliman, a noted academic chemist and founder of the</span> <span class="style1">American Journal of Science</span><span class="style0">. Professor Silliman would later testify on behalf of Morse when his claims to the invention of the telegraph were disputed. Morse’s experiences were very similar to most individuals holding patents on inventions which subsequently became valuable. He was assailed by claim-jumpers, people who either genuinely believed that their work predated the inventor with patent, or who were willing to fabricate evidence in support of their earlier claim. Money is a powerful motivation, and scientists would frequently demonstrate their venality by attempting to take credit for someone else’s work.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In 1835 Morse had constructed a rudimentary model of his telegraph. Over the next two years he tried to drum up interest. Initially, the US government showed some interest in this potentially new form of communication, but quickly grew tired of Morse, describing him as an individual “whom ten Congresses regarded as a <span id="anchor_1194_54"></span>nuisance.”<a href="ch51.html#anchor_1508_0">²²</a> Morse also failed to enlist support in Britain or Europe. In Britain, where scientists had also been pursuing a form of telegraphic information transfer, he could not even obtain a patent.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Eventually, though, Morse’s persistence paid off. In the US Congress of 1842–43, a bill was sponsored providing funds of $30,000 ($1.75m) to develop and test his invention. Not everyone was convinced; during the debate, Representative Cave Johnson from Tennessee said that if Congress wanted to promote electromagnetism it should also encourage Mesmerism, and proposed that the appropriation should be split with a lecturer on that topic. Another amendment proposed that half the money should go to the Millerites, a religious group predicting the second coming of Christ in 1844.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In spite of such ridicule, there was sufficient support for the Bill to be passed. At the same time Morse was granted a patent on his work. Morse and Vail built a working model between Washington and Baltimore and performed repeated demonstrations of the ability to transmit information beyond visible distances without significant delay. In 1844, his first message from Baltimore to the US Capitol was: “What has God wrought?”</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Nevertheless, the two men were left with a sceptical audience, and the government remained sufficiently sceptical as to its practical use and its potential for earning meaningful revenue that they turned down an offer from Morse to sell them the telegraph for $100,000 ($15m).</span> </p>
