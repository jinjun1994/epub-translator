<p class="align-center"><span class="style0">“The New York railways have been worked with no common-sense and judicious object … They [the American railroads] have been regarded as mere links in a system which has reached to the extremity of Illinois, crossed the Mississippi, and penetrated into Missouri almost beyond the haunts of man, and one which will one day penetrate to the Pacific, and monopolise the carrying of tea from China. This is the rock upon which the American railways have struck … the more distant and worthless the traffic, the greater have been the sacrifices to encourage and secure it … What a different system from that which obtains in England, and how much less satisfactory to the share and bondholders!”</span> </p>
