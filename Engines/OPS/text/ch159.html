<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the early years, the networking of large computers had been largely restricted to arms of government and academia. It was funded and developed by the US government, largely through the military budget and for military purposes. It is unlikely that such projects would ever have been undertaken by the private sector, as networks involved very obvious costs but no obvious revenues of meaningful size. The costs included basic research and the cost of building physical networks and large-scale computing facilities. Even after the establishment of ARPA in the early 1960s, the cost of developing what is now the Internet continued to be largely borne by government out of public funds.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Commercial interest for most of the period was confined to military functions and the provision of equipment, expertise and maintenance. Manufacturers of servers, cables and switching equipment witnessed growing demand as the network of computers expanded. However, the real growth was not to come until the network sped up and increasing numbers of local area networks (LANs) could be linked by the Internet to networks externally. The majority of early local networks were in academic institutions, with email the principal use. Gradually, however, businesses that would otherwise have been unable to fund such long-distance connections began to take advantage of the new medium. Of these, the most notable was Cisco Systems, which emerged from Stanford University in 1984, formed by a small group of academics seeking to capitalise on the improvements in computer system connectivity.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">At Stanford University, the husband-and-wife team of Sandy Lerner from the Graduate School of Business and Leonard Bosack of the Computer Science Department were so frustrated by the inability to communicate by electronic mail that they embarked on a course that would ultimately result in the creation of one of the world’s largest companies. They had met some years before when they both used a timesharing system in Stanford University’s computer science department. Later, as staff at the same institution, and despite both having access to computer networks, the couple could not communicate with each other because each department was connected to a different network. This was far from unique. In 1982 Stanford housed some 5,000 computers, the majority of which could not talk to each other directly.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The only connection that could be made was through the ARPANET. This involved sending an email to the ARPANET for transmission before receiving it back through the IMP terminal and then on to the indicated recipient. This was an unduly clumsy method of communicating, when in theory a link between the local networks could complete the same task without going anywhere near the ARPANET. Stanford was not short of such sites, having developed many local area networks as a result of Xerox’s largesse in distributing ethernet equipment. The task facing Bosack and Lerner was somehow to link these local networks and allow them to communicate, while not interfering with the network’s jealously guarded operational independence.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">To achieve this, they enlisted some engineering help from colleagues and built an updated IMP, originally developed by BBN for the ARPANET. This ‘router’ assisted the email and information transfer between networks. Since email was the pre-eminent function, or ‘killer application’, on the Internet, the development of routers which speeded up the process was a vital cog in the future development of the Web. The efforts of the team including Bosack and Lerner were sufficiently successful for Stanford to adopt the system officially into the university network. Bosack and Lerner found that demand from other universities for the equipment grew sharply as word of mouth (or more accurately, email) disseminated their success. But when they tried to set up a commercial venture alongside their academic efforts, they found the university unwilling to sanction the use of either resources or office space. Bosack and Lerner left to set up their own operation, which they named ‘Cisco’.</span> </p>
