<p><span class="style0">The next step was to create the Web server, that is, the software to facilitate retention of pages and access to them. By Christmas 1990 a prototype version was up and running at CERN, but to generalise the system Berners-Lee needed to establish a set of standards, just as the Internet had to establish the TCP/IP standards before it could function. Achieving this end required that he maintain and increase his efforts as an evangelist for the World Wide Web and the protocols which supported it, in the face of scepticism and many academic and commercial rivalries.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Unlike the Internet, where the funders could specify a protocol, the World Wide Web required others to adopt its conventions. Its non-invasive nature was a strong selling point since it did not require users to make changes to their own systems in order to use it. Against it was the lack of developed tools and a critical mass of established users. Berners-Lee described the process as akin to pushing a bobsleigh – an enormous initial effort until the sleigh picks up speed and gains a momentum of its <span id="anchor_4239_89"></span>own.<a href="ch185.html#anchor_4882_0">⁹⁷</a> The next two years were spent frantically encouraging and cajoling others to develop browsers and create a common set of standards, beginning with the URL definitional structure. Without browsers, users could not access information efficiently, and without a common set of standards there would be no information to access. It was a classic chicken-and-egg situation again. Few wished to spend the time developing a browser with more than local area capabilities, purely in the hope that the Internet would one day become more widely accessible. Equally, the move to agree common standards lacked the urgency of a widespread perceived practical need. There was no single or dominant funding body to force a resolution, as had happened with TCP/IP.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Browsers began to emerge in a variety of academic settings, most frequently to assist in accessing information from an institution’s network, but also as standalone student projects. As traffic on the Web grew, browsers gradually began to be disseminated among users. The early browsers represented a great advance on what had gone before, but often involved a lot of effort to install, use and adapt. This is not surprising. They were not specifically designed for Internet use. The enormous commercial potential that later unfolded was not widely foreseen. One exception proved to be at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, where a group including Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina was concentrating on the development of a browser named Mosaic. This work differed from many other browser developments in that it focused specifically on client needs. The Mosaic browser was one of the first to be developed as an easy-to-use tool to the benefit of the development of the Web.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The Mosaic project also appeared to be a rival to the Web – and, to Berners-Lee for one, appeared to be seeking to wrest leadership away from the World Wide Web. At this time, the concept of hypertext information access and retrieval had not yet displaced traditional hierarchical indexing systems. At the University of Minnesota, a gopher information system based on menus had become increasingly popular and adopted outside the university. This came to a sudden halt in 1993 when the university announced its intention to impose a licence fee on non-academic users of its gopher server software. The threat of being held to ransom over intellectual property rights prompted many users to discontinue development work. This crystallised Berners-Lee’s thoughts. If the World Wide Web was to be accepted, he realised, such an overhang had to be removed. After negotiation with CERN, a declaration was made that access to the Web protocol would be free. By the beginning of 1994, therefore, the Web had momentum, it had an established group of interested users which would evolve into the standards governing body, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), it had removed the overhang of protocol property rights and it had an increasing number of user-friendly access tools.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The Internet, which had been funded by government, was therefore augmented by something of the vision articulated by Vannevar Bush some 40 years earlier. This vision was founded on machines being made to assist with the human thought process. It was the practical implementation of this vision that created tools that could sit on top of the Internet to allow it to be fulfilled. The development of these tools had also been largely funded by government, but in a much more ad hoc and decentralised manner. These were mostly software, or intellectual rather than physical products, and were quickly to become recognised as having potential that could grow in proportion to the rapidly expanding Web.</span> </p>
