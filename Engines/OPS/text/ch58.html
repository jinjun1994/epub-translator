<h1 id="anchor_1588_0"><span class="style1">The Brush stock market bubble</span> </h1>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The private sector lost no time in exploring the possibility of developing a profitable alternative to the gas monopolies. To take advantage of the potential profits to be earned in Great Britain, Charles Brush established the Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation in 1880. By early 1882 more than £9m had been raised in Britain to supply electric lighting, both by subsidiaries of the corporation and other companies, most notably the Hammond Company. The equivalent fundraising today would be roughly $3.5</span> <span class="style1">billion</span><span class="style0">!</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">This laid the foundation for the so-called ‘Brush Bubble’, which was to burst 12 months later in 1883 after it became apparent that arc lighting was unable to compete commercially with gas lighting. The bubble, which led to rapidly rising share prices of the electric arc companies, was inflated by the positive sentiment surrounding their future and by anticipation of the potential demise of the gas companies’ monopoly position. Contemporary financial commentaries reveal a mounting enthusiasm for the new threat to gas lighting. The shares of the Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation had risen sevenfold over this short period, while those of the Hammond Company had more than quadrupled. The case for investing in these two concerns came from their licensing arc lighting technology to regional operating companies. Large numbers of these regional companies had been launched on the back of the overpowering enthusiasm for electricity in general, and arc lighting in particular. Typically, the companies were named after the geographic region for which they had the rights to the Brush technology. There were therefore companies such as the Yorkshire Brush Company, and the Warwickshire Brush Company, very similar to Brush franchises in the USA such as the California Electric Company.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Helping to generate end demand for a product was not a new business strategy even in the 1800s. Before installing arc lighting, a large amount of initial capital was required to fund the cost of the necessary infrastructure. If co-funding could help Brush expand the potential market, then the returns to his manufacturing concerns would increase accordingly. His decision to help establish the operating companies was assisted by the fact that the level of excitement in the market caused the share prices of the operating companies to rise immediately to a premium, based solely on the expectation of future profits. The Brush investment not only assisted product sales; it also brought an instantaneous capital return from the share premium – or this is how it would have seemed at the time.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:10px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The key question was whether the new technology would actually prove to be a cost-efficient advance on the existing system of gas lighting. With the excitement of the era and the appearance of almost instantaneous profits, it was taken as read that arc lighting would eventually prevail. Those who doubted this were derided as unimaginative and unable to understand the implications of the technological change which had taken place, much as was to happen in the Internet bubble more than 100 years later.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Among all the excitement, some among the financial community did retain a veneer of restraint. There were references to the “greed of promoters”, and to the possibility that speculators or those seeking instantaneous profits on new issues, “the mere premium-hunting class”, were inflating prices. It was often explicitly acknowledged that the volume of new issuance was likely to saturate the market. Even so, a recurrent theme was that, notwithstanding any excesses, the prospects for electric light were so strong that profits would inevitably result.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">Human nature being what it is, investors readily interpreted these warnings to mean the share prices would continue to rise, though maybe not as fast as they had up to that point. Reinforcing this message were supposedly cautionary notes that were likely to have the exact opposite effect. For example: “A telegram has been received this week from New York stating that the 200 dols. shares of the original American ‘Brush’ Company actually command 7,000 dols. In other words, 40 pounds sterling is actually worth 1,400 pounds sterling!”</span> </p>
