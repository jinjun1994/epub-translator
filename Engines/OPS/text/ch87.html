<p><span class="style0">The automobile had taken time to stimulate any meaningful response in America, but by the mid-1890s this had begun to change. Reports of the races in Europe and the developments of Daimler and Benz began to influence opinion in America such that home-produced vehicles began to emerge. The coverage of the Paris-Bordeaux-Paris race excited widespread interest in America, and by September 1895 the US Patent Office had received over 500 applications related to the automobile. As its potential became more recognised, a New York patent attorney by the name of George Selden decided to seek a patent on his ‘improved road engine’. This was granted in November 1895, some 15 years after his original application. Selden may not have been at the technological forefront so far as the automobile was concerned but he was certainly one of the first to recognise the significance of the development that had been fostered in Europe.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Others also shared his vision and had progressed well beyond the paper construct of Selden. A range of automobiles had been constructed and tested in America over the years leading up the excitement of 1895. Steam-powered vehicles had been built by Ransom Olds, a Michigan machinist, in the late 1880s and early 1890s. An electric car had been designed by William Morrison in Iowa and given a public view in Chicago in 1892, while in 1894 Henry Morris of Philadelphia had built the ‘Electrobat’. So far as a car powered by a gasoline engine was concerned, the Duryea brothers had wheeled out their first successful model in 1893 and in 1895 had defeated the heavier Benz automobile in the</span> <span class="style1">Chicago Times-Herald</span> <span class="style0">race. Interestingly, one of the major factors was that the Benz had been designed to run on the relatively well-paved roads of Europe while the Duryea had to combat the sandy, poor quality tracks prevalent in America. The race was run in poor weather conditions, with muddy roads, which the Benz was simply too heavy to negotiate.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">The early ‘races’ in general were more endurance trials than speed events, although speed did become an issue as time progressed. The Vanderbilt Challenge Cup, donated by Willie K. Vanderbilt and run at Long Island in 1904 under the auspices of the American Automobile Association, was won by a car which averaged over 50 mph. This was a long way from the early days of racing when the less-than-impressed spectators were prone to chant ‘get a horse’. The introduction of races in America was of vital importance in the development of the automobile since it was one of the main methods of drawing public attention, absolutely necessary if funds were to be forthcoming in financing future development. The need for an automobile industry in America was explicitly recognised in the press, which helped the efforts of entrepreneurs soldiering to build viable automobiles. The relationship between the press and the automobile was symbiotic. Just as the railway, electricity and the telephone had stimulated the birth of magazines to provide information and news on these new inventions, so too did the automobile. Publications such as</span> <span class="style1">The Horseless Age</span> <span class="style0">in America and</span> <span class="style1">Autocar</span> <span class="style0">in Britain appeared in 1895 to cater for the growing levels of interest in the new form of transport.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style1">William K. Vanderbilt had shipped a Daimler automobile from Cannstatt with the sobriquet the ‘White Ghost’. Willie K., as he was known, then proceeded to drive the vehicle at great speed on Long Island and in the process come into repeated contact with both the local constabulary and grazing animals. So far as the latter were concerned, Willie K. would pay damages for the stricken beast. Eventually this was to become almost a cottage industry in the area. As soon as his automobile was sighted at the Manhattan ferry the Long Island locals would round up elderly livestock and attempt to ensure that the unfortunate beasts made contact with the ‘White Ghost’. Some farmers even purchased disabled streetcar horses for that very purpose. “The farmers have discovered that a horse which isn’t worth over $6 for glue and fertilizer will bring $65 to $100 when killed by a Vanderbilt auto… Animals were routinely shoved in the way of his car. Fights would break out over who should have the privilege of having his horse hit first… Newspapers estimated that it cost Willie K. $47.23 a mile to take pleasure trips to the island. The carnage ended when a couple of nearsighted speculators had their beasts struck by non-Vanderbilt vehicles; Willie K. grew suspicious and announced plans to ‘employ a claims agent to adjust losses’.”</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">In the mid-1890s, Europe still held the lead in the design and construction of the automobile. Within ten years, though, it was effectively supplanted by new producers in North America. The European automobiles were individually constructed and hence expensive to run and maintain; they were heavy since European roads were typically surfaced; and they attracted a tariff on importation to America. As a consequence, their penetration of the American market had been relatively limited.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">Demonstrating that the technology worked was one thing, but what the market required was a vehicle that would be able to displace the horse-drawn carriage on the basis of cost. Perhaps the lack of roads in America had left it behind Europe, there being only 200 miles of surfaced roads outside of urban areas. Whatever the reason, America’s rapidly growing economy and the wealth it was creating was swiftly making it the single largest homogeneous market in the world. In Britain the existing carriers, most notably the stagecoaches and the railways, had successfully created barriers such as the red flag laws to inhibit the progress of their new competitor. In continental Europe, the focus had increasingly been on the creation of larger and more expensive vehicles. The market gap that existed, therefore, was for the affordable horse-and-carriage replacement. This was the gap that inventors in America sought to fill.</span> </p>
