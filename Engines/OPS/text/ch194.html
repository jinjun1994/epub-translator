<p><span class="style0">By the time the first edition of the book was published in 2001 we had clearly entered stage 3 of the technology cycle, the period when investor scepticism is rising and bringing into question the viability of many businesses that have hitherto seen few barriers to fundraising. As funds dried up, all the traditional valuation metrics that had been ignored up to that point came back with a vengeance – and returned real power to companies that had either raised funds already or had genuinine self-financing businesses. This, combined with rising capital costs and general investor unease, created the conditions under which the valuation edifice collapsed.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">History strongly suggested that it would take many years for the excesses in stock markets and the levels of valuation seen in 1998–2000 to unwind, and so it proved. Most leading stock markets fell by around 50% when the bubble burst and the market did not start to revive for three years. Having briefly matched its 2000 peak in 2007, the S&amp;P 500 index only decisively surpassed the level it reached at the height of the bubble in 2013. The Nasdaq index, where many of the new economy stocks were listed, did not reach its 2000 peak again until 2015. In real, inflation-adjusted terms, most stock markets took at least a decade to recover their losses.</span> </p>

<p><span class="style0">It is true that you cannot attribute all this performance to the fallout from the Internet bubble. The global financial crisis of 2007–08 killed off the new bull market in equities that began in 2003 and was close to regaining the former highs when it was aborted, prompting a second severe bear market. That crisis had many roots, however, at least one of which – the easy monetary policy adopted by the Federal Reserve and other central banks – can be attributed in part to the fallout from the earlier Internet bubble.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">In the bond market, long-term yields declined steadily after 2000. For some this was the consequence of a number of global deflationary forces continuing to weigh on the fixed-interest markets. One of those forces, as noted earlier, was the destructive side effect of technological advance on established business models, a factor which was both explicit and widely forecast in the case of the Internet and the coincident changes in telecommunications and social behaviour. A great many things became cheaper. A huge amount of capital was also destroyed in the decade. This effect was partially masked for a while by the extraordinary explosion in credit that preceded and helped to cause the banking crisis of 2007–08.</span> </p>

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;"></div>
<p><span class="style0">The shocking events of 9/11 rightly traumatised much of the world but arguably served to alter the path of economic policy. From a position of raising interest rates to moderate economic growth, the monetary taps were turned on both in the banking sector and the non-bank sector, leading to an explosion of securitised debt. The normal economic consequences would have been inflation which, in turn, would have eventually been met with monetary tightening. However, the backdrop of the efficiencies brought about by the Internet, together with a flood of new incremental supply from the reintegration of China and India into global markets, meant that there was little obvious sign of inflation. As a consequence the main inflation which was sustained was an inflation in asset prices, while debt continued to balloon to high and unsustainable levels.</span> </p>
